{"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language": {"base_content": "Spanish (espa\u00f1ol) or Castilian (castellano) is a Romance language of the Indo-European language family that evolved from the Vulgar Latin spoken on the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. Today, it is a global language with about 500 million native speakers, mainly in the Americas and Spain, and about 600 million speakers including second language speakers. Spanish is the official language of 20 countries, as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Spanish is the world's second-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese; the world's fourth-most spoken language overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu); and the world's most widely spoken Romance language. The country with the largest population of native speakers is Mexico.\nSpanish is part of the Ibero-Romance language group, in which the language is also known as Castilian (castellano). The group evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century, and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo, a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th century. Spanish colonialism in the early modern period spurred the introduction of the language to overseas locations, most notably to the Americas.\nAs a Romance language, Spanish is a descendant of Latin. Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is Latin in origin, including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek. Alongside English and French, it is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world. Spanish is well represented in the humanities and social sciences. Spanish is also the third most used language on the internet by number of users after English and Chinese and the second most used language by number of websites after English.\nSpanish is used as an official language by many international organizations, including the United Nations, European Union, Organization of American States, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, African Union, among others.\n\nName of the language and etymology\nName of the language\nIn Spain and some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish is called not only espa\u00f1ol but also castellano (Castilian), the language from the Kingdom of Castile, contrasting it with other languages spoken in Spain such as Galician, Basque, Asturian, Catalan/Valencian, Aragonese, Occitan and other minor languages.\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term castellano to define the official language of the whole of Spain, in contrast to las dem\u00e1s lenguas espa\u00f1olas (lit. \"the other Spanish languages\"). Article III reads as follows:\n\nEl castellano es la lengua espa\u00f1ola oficial del Estado. ... Las dem\u00e1s lenguas espa\u00f1olas ser\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n oficiales en las respectivas Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas...\nCastilian is the official Spanish language of the State. ... The other Spanish languages shall also be official in their respective Autonomous Communities...\nThe Royal Spanish Academy (Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola), on the other hand, currently uses the term espa\u00f1ol in its publications. However, from 1713 to 1923, it called the language castellano.\nThe Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas (a language guide published by the Royal Spanish Academy) states that, although the Royal Spanish Academy prefers to use the term espa\u00f1ol in its publications when referring to the Spanish language, both terms\u2014espa\u00f1ol and castellano\u2014are regarded as synonymous and equally valid.\n\nEtymology\nThe term castellano is related to Castile (Castilla or archaically Castiella), the kingdom where the language was originally spoken. The name Castile, in turn, is usually assumed to be derived from castillo ('castle').\nIn the Middle Ages, the language spoken in Castile was generically referred to as Romance and later also as Lengua vulgar. Later in the period, it gained geographical specification as Romance castellano (romanz castellano, romanz de Castiella), lenguaje de Castiella, and ultimately simply as castellano (noun).\nDifferent etymologies have been suggested for the term espa\u00f1ol (Spanish). According to the Royal Spanish Academy, espa\u00f1ol derives from the Occitan word espaignol and that, in turn, derives from the Vulgar Latin *hispaniolus ('of Hispania'). Hispania was the Roman name for the entire Iberian Peninsula.\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Spanish philologist Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal suggested that the classic hispanus or hispanicus took the suffix -one from Vulgar Latin, as happened with other words such as bret\u00f3n (Breton) or saj\u00f3n (Saxon).\n\nHistory\nLike the other Romance languages, the Spanish language evolved from Vulgar Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 BC. Several pre-Roman languages (also called Paleohispanic languages)\u2014some distantly related to Latin as Indo-European languages, and some that are not related at all\u2014were previously spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included Proto-Basque, Iberian, Lusitanian, Celtiberian and Gallaecian.\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era, the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring Romance languages\u2014Mozarabic (Andalusi Romance), Navarro-Aragonese, Leonese, Catalan/Valencian, Portuguese, Galician, Occitan, and later, French and Italian. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from Arabic, as well as a minor influence from the Germanic Gothic language through the period of Visigoth rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from Latin through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both Classical Latin and Renaissance Latin, the form of Latin in use at that time.\nAccording to the theories of Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal, local sociolects of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of Burgos, and this dialect was later brought to the city of Toledo, where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century. In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, Leonese, and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see Iberian Romance languages). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the Reconquista, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the Arabic of Al-Andalus, much of it indirectly, through the Romance Mozarabic dialects (some 4,000 Arabic-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today). The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of Toledo, in the 13th to 16th centuries, and Madrid, from the 1570s.\nThe development of the Spanish sound system from that of Vulgar Latin exhibits most of the changes that are typical of Western Romance languages, including lenition of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin v\u012bta > Spanish vida). The diphthongization of Latin stressed short e and o\u2014which occurred in open syllables in French and Italian, but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese\u2014is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish, as shown in the following table:\n\nSpanish is marked by palatalization of the Latin double consonants (geminates) nn and ll (thus Latin\nannum > Spanish a\u00f1o, and Latin anellum > Spanish\nanillo).\nThe consonant written u or v in Latin and pronounced [w] in Classical Latin had probably \"fortified\" to a bilabial fricative /\u03b2/ in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it merged with the consonant written b (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones). In modern Spanish, there is no difference between the pronunciation of orthographic b and v.\nTypical of Spanish (as also of neighboring Gascon extending as far north as the Gironde estuary, and found in a small area of Calabria), attributed by some scholars to a Basque substratum was the mutation of Latin initial f into h- whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. The h-, still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects, it is still aspirated in some words. Because of borrowings from Latin and neighboring Romance languages, there are many f-/h- doublets in modern Spanish: Fernando and Hernando (both Spanish for \"Ferdinand\"), ferrero and herrero (both Spanish for \"smith\"), fierro and hierro (both Spanish for \"iron\"), and fondo and hondo (both words pertaining to depth in Spanish, though fondo means \"bottom\", while hondo means \"deep\"); additionally, hacer (\"to make\") is cognate to the root word of satisfacer (\"to satisfy\"), and hecho (\"made\") is similarly cognate to the root word of satisfecho (\"satisfied\").\nCompare the examples in the following table:\n\nSome consonant clusters of Latin also produced characteristically different results in these languages, as shown in the examples in the following table:\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants, known in Spanish as the reajuste de las sibilantes, which resulted in the distinctive velar [x] pronunciation of the letter \u27e8j\u27e9 and\u2014in a large part of Spain\u2014the characteristic interdental [\u03b8] (\"th-sound\") for the letter \u27e8z\u27e9 (and for \u27e8c\u27e9 before \u27e8e\u27e9 or \u27e8i\u27e9). See History of Spanish (Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants) for details.\nThe Gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana, written in Salamanca in 1492 by Elio Antonio de Nebrija, was the first grammar written for a modern European language. According to a popular anecdote, when Nebrija presented it to Queen Isabella I, she asked him what was the use of such a work, and he answered that language is the instrument of empire. In his introduction to the grammar, dated 18 August 1492, Nebrija wrote that \"... language was always the companion of empire.\"\nFrom the 16th century onwards, the language was taken to the Spanish-discovered America and the Spanish East Indies via Spanish colonization of America. Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote, is such a well-known reference in the world that Spanish is often called la lengua de Cervantes (\"the language of Cervantes\").\nIn the 20th century, Spanish was introduced to Equatorial Guinea and the Western Sahara, and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire, such as Spanish Harlem in New York City. For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see Influences on the Spanish language.\n\nGeographical distribution\nSpanish is the primary language in 20 countries worldwide. As of 2023, it is estimated that about 486 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it the second most spoken language by number of native speakers. An additional 75 million speak Spanish as a second or foreign language, making it the fourth most spoken language in the world overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindi with a total number of 538 million speakers. Spanish is also the third most used language on the Internet, after English and Chinese.\n\nEurope\nSpanish is the official language of Spain. Upon the emergence of the Castilian Crown as the dominant power in the Iberian Peninsula by the end of the Middle Ages, the Romance vernacular associated with this polity became increasingly used in instances of prestige and influence, and the distinction between \"Castilian\" and \"Spanish\" started to become blurred. Hard policies imposing the language's hegemony in an intensely centralising Spanish state were established from the 18th century onward.\nOther European territories in which it is also widely spoken include Gibraltar and Andorra.\nSpanish is also spoken by immigrant communities in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. Spanish is an official language of the European Union.\n\nAmericas\nHispanic America\nToday, the majority of the Spanish speakers live in Hispanic America. Nationally, Spanish is the official language\u2014either de facto or de jure\u2014of Argentina, Bolivia (co-official with 36 indigenous languages), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (co-official with 63 indigenous languages), Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay (co-official with Guaran\u00ed), Peru (co-official with Quechua, Aymara, and \"the other indigenous languages\"), Puerto Rico (co-official with English), Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\nUnited States\nSpanish language has a long history in the territory of the current-day United States dating back to the 16th century. In the wake of the 1848 Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty, hundreds of thousands of Spanish speakers became a minoritized community in the United States. The 20th century saw further massive growth of Spanish speakers in areas where they had been hitherto scarce.\nAccording to the 2020 census, over 60 million people of the U.S. population were of Hispanic or Hispanic American by origin. In turn, 41.8 million people in the United States aged five or older speak Spanish at home, or about 13% of the population. Spanish predominates in the unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico, where it is also an official language along with English.\nSpanish is by far the most common second language in the country, with over 50 million total speakers if non-native or second-language speakers are included. While English is the de facto national language of the country, Spanish is often used in public services and notices at the federal and state levels. Spanish is also used in administration in the state of New Mexico. The language has a strong influence in major metropolitan areas such as those of Los Angeles, Miami, San Antonio, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Tucson and Phoenix of the Arizona Sun Corridor, as well as more recently, Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa, Raleigh and Baltimore-Washington, D.C. due to 20th- and 21st-century immigration.\n\nRest of the Americas\nAlthough Spanish has no official recognition in the former British colony of Belize (known until 1973 as British Honduras) where English is the sole official language, according to the 2022 census, 54% of the total population are able to speak the language.\nDue to its proximity to Spanish-speaking countries and small existing native Spanish speaking minority, Trinidad and Tobago has implemented Spanish language teaching into its education system. The Trinidadian and Tobagonian government launched the Spanish as a First Foreign Language (SAFFL) initiative in March 2005. \nSpanish has historically had a significant presence on the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao (ABC Islands) throughout the centuries and in present times. The majority of the populations of each island (especially Aruba) speaking Spanish at varying although often high degrees of fluency. The local language Papiamentu (Papiamento on Aruba) is heavily influenced by Venezuelan Spanish.\nIn addition to sharing most of its borders with Spanish-speaking countries, the creation of Mercosur in the early 1990s induced a favorable situation for the promotion of Spanish language teaching in Brazil. In 2005, the National Congress of Brazil approved a bill, signed into law by the President, making it mandatory for schools to offer Spanish as an alternative foreign language course in both public and private secondary schools in Brazil. In September 2016 this law was revoked by Michel Temer after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. In many border towns and villages along Paraguay and Uruguay, a mixed language known as Portu\u00f1ol is spoken.\n\nAfrica\nSub-Saharan Africa\nEquatorial Guinea is the only Spanish-speaking country located entirely in Africa, with the language introduced during the Spanish colonial period. Enshrined in the constitution as an official language (alongside French and Portuguese), Spanish features prominently in the Equatoguinean education system and is the primary language used in government and business. Whereas it is not the mother tongue of virtually any of its speakers, the vast majority of the population is proficient in Spanish. The Instituto Cervantes estimates that 87.7% of the population is fluent in Spanish. The proportion of proficient Spanish speakers in Equatorial Guinea exceeds the proportion of proficient speakers in other West and Central African nations of their respective colonial languages.\nSpanish is spoken by very small communities in Angola due to Cuban influence from the Cold War and in South Sudan among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned for their country's independence.\n\nNorth Africa and Macaronesia\nSpanish is also spoken in the integral territories of Spain in Africa, namely the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean some 100 km (62 mi) off the northwest of the African mainland. The Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands traces its origins back to the Castilian conquest in the 15th century, and, in addition to a resemblance to Western Andalusian speech patterns, it also features strong influence from the Spanish varieties spoken in the Americas, which in turn have also been influenced historically by Canarian Spanish. The Spanish spoken in North Africa by native bilingual speakers of Arabic or Berber who also speak Spanish as a second language features characteristics involving the variability of the vowel system.\nWhile far from its heyday during the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, the Spanish language has some presence in northern Morocco, stemming for example from the availability of certain Spanish-language media. According to a 2012 survey by Morocco's Royal Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES), penetration of Spanish in Morocco reaches 4.6% of the population. Many northern Moroccans have rudimentary knowledge of Spanish, with Spanish being particularly significant in areas adjacent to Ceuta and Melilla. Spanish also has a presence in the education system of the country (through either selected education centers implementing Spain's education system, primarily located in the North, or the availability of Spanish as foreign language subject in secondary education).\nIn Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, a primarily Hassaniya Arabic-speaking territory, Spanish was officially spoken as the language of the colonial administration during the late 19th and 20th centuries. Today, Spanish is present in the partially-recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as its secondary official language, and in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf (Algeria), where the Spanish language is still taught as a second language, largely by Cuban educators. The number of Spanish speakers is unknown.\nSpanish is also an official language of the African Union.\n\nAsia\nSpanish was an official language of the Philippines from the beginning of Spanish administration in 1565 to a constitutional change in 1973. During Spanish colonization, it was the language of government, trade, and education, and was spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos (Ilustrados). Despite a public education system set up by the colonial government, by the end of Spanish rule in 1898, only about 10% of the population had knowledge of Spanish, mostly those of Spanish descent or elite standing.\n\nSpanish continued to be official and used in Philippine literature and press during the early years of American administration after the Spanish\u2013American War but was eventually replaced by English as the primary language of administration and education by the 1920s. Nevertheless, despite a significant decrease in influence and speakers, Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines upon independence in 1946, alongside English and Filipino, a standardized version of Tagalog.\nSpanish was briefly removed from official status in 1973 but reimplemented under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos two months later. It remained an official language until the ratification of the present constitution in 1987, in which it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language. Additionally, the constitution, in its Article XIV, stipulates that the Government shall provide the people of the Philippines with a Spanish-language translation of the country's constitution. In recent years changing attitudes among non-Spanish speaking Filipinos have helped spur a revival of the language, and starting in 2009 Spanish was reintroduced as part of the basic education curriculum in a number of public high schools, becoming the largest foreign language program offered by the public school system, with over 7,000 students studying the language in the 2021\u20132022 school year alone. The local business process outsourcing industry has also helped boost the language's economic prospects. Today, while the actual number of proficient Spanish speakers is around 400,000, or under 0.5% of the population, a new generation of Spanish speakers in the Philippines has likewise emerged, though speaker estimates vary widely.\nAside from standard Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language called Chavacano developed in the southern Philippines. However, it is not mutually intelligible with Spanish. The number of Chavacano-speakers was estimated at 1.2 million in 1996. The local languages of the Philippines also retain significant Spanish influence, with many words derived from Mexican Spanish, owing to the administration of the islands by Spain through New Spain until 1821, until direct governance from Madrid afterwards to 1898.\n\nOceania\nSpanish is the official and most spoken language on Easter Island, which is geographically part of Polynesia in Oceania and politically part of Chile. However, Easter Island's traditional language is Rapa Nui, an Eastern Polynesian language.\nAs a legacy of comprising the former Spanish East Indies, Spanish loan words are present in the local languages of Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Marshall Islands and Micronesia.\nIn addition, in Australia and New Zealand, there are native Spanish communities, resulting from emigration from Spanish-speaking countries (mainly from the Southern Cone).\n\nSpanish speakers by country\n20 countries and one United States territory speak Spanish officially, and the language has a significant unofficial presence in the rest of the United States along with Andorra, Belize and the territory of Gibraltar.\n\nGrammar\nMost of the grammatical and typological features of Spanish are shared with the other Romance languages. Spanish is a fusional language. The noun and adjective systems exhibit two genders and two numbers. In addition, articles and some pronouns and determiners have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty conjugated forms per verb, with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 verboid forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. The indicative mood is the unmarked one, while the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty or indetermination, and is commonly paired with the conditional, which is a mood used to express \"would\" (as in, \"I would eat if I had food\"); the imperative is a mood to express a command, commonly a one word phrase \u2013 \"\u00a1Di!\" (\"Talk!\").\nVerbs express T-V distinction by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see Spanish verbs and Spanish irregular verbs.)\nSpanish syntax is considered right-branching, meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after head words. The language uses prepositions (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case), and usually\u2014though not always\u2014places adjectives after nouns, as do most other Romance languages.\nSpanish is classified as a subject\u2013verb\u2013object language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by topicalization and focus. It is a \"pro-drop\", or \"null-subject\" language\u2014that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are pragmatically unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"verb-framed\" language, meaning that the direction of motion is expressed in the verb while the mode of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. subir corriendo or salir volando; the respective English equivalents of these examples\u2014'to run up' and 'to fly out'\u2014show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\nPhonology\nThe Spanish phonological system evolved from that of Vulgar Latin. Its development exhibits some traits in common with other Western Romance languages, others with the neighboring Hispanic varieties\u2014especially Leonese and Aragonese\u2014as well as other features unique to Spanish. Spanish is alone among its immediate neighbors in having undergone frequent aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial /f/ sound (e.g. Cast. harina vs. Leon. and Arag. farina). The Latin initial consonant sequences pl-, cl-, and fl- in Spanish typically merge as ll- (originally pronounced [\u028e]), while in Aragonese they are preserved in most dialects, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including [t\u0283], [\u0283], and [\u028e]. Where Latin had -li- before a vowel (e.g. filius) or the ending -iculus, -icula (e.g. auricula), Old Spanish produced [\u0292], that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative [x] (hijo, oreja), whereas neighboring languages have the palatal lateral [\u028e] (e.g. Portuguese filho, orelha; Catalan fill, orella).\n\nSegmental phonology\nThe Spanish phonemic inventory consists of five vowel phonemes (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect). The main allophonic variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels /i/ and /u/ to glides\u2014[j] and [w] respectively\u2014when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels /e/ and /o/, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs /je/ and /we/ respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as morphophonemic rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three nasal phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) lateral phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position lose their contrast and are subject to assimilation to a following consonant; (2) three voiceless stops and the affricate /t\u0283/; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) voiceless fricatives; (4) a set of voiced obstruents\u2014/b/, /d/, /\u0261/, and sometimes /\u029d/\u2014which alternate between approximant and plosive allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"tapped\" and \"trilled\" r-sounds (single \u27e8r\u27e9 and double \u27e8rr\u27e9 in orthography).\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, /\u028e/ is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with /\u029d/ in the merger called ye\u00edsmo. Similarly, /\u03b8/ is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from /s/ (see seseo), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\nThe phoneme /\u0283/ is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in loanwords. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes /b/, /d/, /\u029d/, and /\u0261/ appears to the right of a pair of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the voiceless phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the voiced ones alternate allophonically (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\nProsody\nSpanish is classified by its rhythm as a syllable-timed language: each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress.\nSpanish intonation varies significantly according to dialect but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh-questions (who, what, why, etc.) and rising tone for yes/no questions. There are no syntactic markers to distinguish between questions and statements and thus, the recognition of declarative or interrogative depends entirely on intonation.\nStress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word, with some rare exceptions at the fourth-to-last or earlier syllables. Stress tends to occur as follows:\n\nin words that end with a monophthong, on the penultimate syllable\nwhen the word ends in a diphthong, on the final syllable.\nin words that end with a consonant, on the last syllable, with the exception of two grammatical endings: -n, for third-person-plural of verbs, and -s, for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs. However, even though a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with -n are also stressed on the penult (joven, virgen, mitin), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with -n are stressed on their last syllable (capit\u00e1n, almac\u00e9n, jard\u00edn, coraz\u00f3n).\nPreantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with clitic pronouns attached (e.g. guard\u00e1ndoselos 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous minimal pairs that contrast solely on stress such as s\u00e1bana ('sheet') and sabana ('savannah'); l\u00edmite ('boundary'), limite ('he/she limits') and limit\u00e9 ('I limited'); l\u00edquido ('liquid'), liquido ('I sell off') and liquid\u00f3 ('he/she sold off').\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is \u27e8n\u27e9, \u27e8s\u27e9, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (See Spanish orthography.)\n\nSpeaker population\nSpanish is the official, or national language in 18 countries and one territory in the Americas, Spain, and Equatorial Guinea. With a population of over 410 million, Hispanophone America accounts for the vast majority of Spanish speakers, of which Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country. In the European Union, Spanish is the mother tongue of 8% of the population, with an additional 7% speaking it as a second language. Additionally, Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States and is by far the most popular foreign language among students. In 2015, it was estimated that over 50 million Americans spoke Spanish, about 41 million of whom were native speakers. With continued immigration and increased use of the language domestically in public spheres and media, the number of Spanish speakers in the United States is expected to continue growing over the forthcoming decades.\n\nDialectal variation\nWhile being mutually intelligible, there are important variations (phonological, grammatical, and lexical) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\nThe national variety with the most speakers is Mexican Spanish. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the reduction or loss of unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.\nIn Spain, northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard, although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last 50 years. The speech from the educated classes of Madrid is the standard variety for use on radio and television in Spain and it is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish. Central (European) Spanish speech patterns have been noted to be in the process of merging with more innovative southern varieties (including Eastern Andalusian and Murcian), as an emerging interdialectal levelled koine buffered between the Madrid's traditional national standard and the Seville speech trends.\n\nPhonology\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme /\u03b8/, (2) the debuccalization of syllable-final /s/, (3) the sound of the spelled \u27e8s\u27e9, (4) and the phoneme /\u028e/.\n\nThe phoneme /\u03b8/ (spelled c before e or i and spelled \u27e8z\u27e9 elsewhere), a voiceless dental fricative as in English thing, is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the Canary Islands, and the Americas), /\u03b8/ does not exist and /s/ occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called distinci\u00f3n in Spanish, while the merger is generally called seseo (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as [s]) or, occasionally, ceceo (referring to its interdental realization, [\u03b8], in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled \u27e8c\u27e9 before \u27e8e\u27e9 or \u27e8i\u27e9, and spelled \u27e8z\u27e9 is always pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant.\nThe debuccalization (pronunciation as [h], or loss) of syllable-final /s/ is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and aspiraci\u00f3n in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final /s/ is pronounced as voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant or as a voiceless dental sibilant in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\nThe sound that corresponds to the letter \u27e8s\u27e9 is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant [s\u033a] (also described acoustically as \"grave\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of retroflex fricatives. In Andalusia, Canary Islands and most of Hispanic America (except in the Paisa region of Colombia) it is pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant [s], much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English.\nThe phoneme /\u028e/, spelled \u27e8ll\u27e9, a palatal lateral consonant that can be approximated by the sound of the \u27e8lli\u27e9 of English million, tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in the highland areas of South America, as well as in Paraguay and lowland Bolivia. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish speakers, it is merged with /\u029d/ (\"curly-tail j\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English /j/ (yod) as in yacht and spelled \u27e8y\u27e9 in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled \u27e8ll\u27e9 and the spelled \u27e8y\u27e9 is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called ye\u00edsmo in Spanish. In Rioplatense Spanish, the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced [\u0292] (as in English measure or the French \u27e8j\u27e9) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region (zhe\u00edsmo), or voiceless [\u0283] (as in the French \u27e8ch\u27e9 or Portuguese \u27e8x\u27e9) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo (she\u00edsmo).\n\nMorphology\nThe main morphological variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns, especially those of the second person and, to a lesser extent, the object pronouns of the third person.\n\nVoseo\nVirtually all dialects of Spanish make the distinction between a formal and a familiar register in the second-person singular and thus have two different pronouns meaning \"you\": usted in the formal and either t\u00fa or vos in the familiar (and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms), with the choice of t\u00fa or vos varying from one dialect to another. The use of vos and its verb forms is called voseo. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with usted, t\u00fa, and vos denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.\nIn voseo, vos is the subject form (vos dec\u00eds, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a preposition (voy con vos, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect object forms, and the possessives, are the same as those associated with t\u00fa: Vos sab\u00e9s que tus amigos te respetan (\"You know your friends respect you\").\nThe verb forms of the general voseo are the same as those used with t\u00fa except in the present tense (indicative and imperative) verbs. The forms for vos generally can be derived from those of vosotros (the traditional second-person familiar plural) by deleting the glide [i\u032f], or /d/, where it appears in the ending: vosotros pens\u00e1is > vos pens\u00e1s; vosotros volv\u00e9is > vos volv\u00e9s, pensad! (vosotros) > pens\u00e1! (vos), volved! (vosotros) > volv\u00e9! (vos).\n\nIn Central American voseo, the t\u00fa and vos forms differ in the present subjunctive as well:\n\nIn Chilean voseo, almost all vos forms are distinct from the corresponding standard t\u00fa-forms.\n\nThe use of the pronoun vos with the verb forms of t\u00fa (vos piensas) is called \"pronominal voseo\". Conversely, the use of the verb forms of vos with the pronoun t\u00fa (t\u00fa pens\u00e1s or t\u00fa pens\u00e1i) is called \"verbal voseo\". In Chile, for example, verbal voseo is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun vos, which is usually reserved for highly informal situations.\n\nDistribution in Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas\nAlthough vos is not used in Spain, it occurs in many Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas as the primary spoken form of the second-person singular familiar pronoun, with wide differences in social consideration. Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of tuteo (the use of t\u00fa) in the following areas: almost all of Mexico, the West Indies, Panama, most of Colombia, Peru, Venezuela and coastal Ecuador.\nTuteo as a cultured form alternates with voseo as a popular or rural form in Bolivia, in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of Zulia), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that voseo can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.\nTuteo exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar voseo in Chile, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, in the Azuero Peninsula in Panama, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and in parts of Guatemala.\nAreas of generalized voseo include Argentina, Nicaragua, eastern Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Colombian departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Quindio and Valle del Cauca.\n\nUstedes\nUstedes functions as formal and informal second-person plural in all of Hispanic America, the Canary Islands, and parts of Andalusia. It agrees with verbs in the 3rd person plural. Most of Spain maintains the formal/familiar distinction with ustedes and vosotros respectively. The use of ustedes with the second person plural is sometimes heard in Andalusia, but it is non-standard.\n\nUsted\nUsted is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a familiar context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of t\u00fa or vos. This usage is sometimes called ustedeo in Spanish.\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, usted is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. Usted is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nThird-person object pronouns\nMost speakers use (and the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola prefers) the pronouns lo and la for direct objects (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of animacy, meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and le for indirect objects (regardless of gender or animacy, meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the accusative and dative pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\nA number of dialects (more common in Spain than in the Americas) use additional rules for the pronouns, such as animacy, or count noun vs. mass noun, rather than just direct vs. indirect object. The ways of using the pronouns in such varieties are called \"le\u00edsmo\", \"lo\u00edsmo\", or \"la\u00edsmo\", according to which respective pronoun, le, lo, or la, covers more than just the etymological usage (le as a direct object, or lo or la as an indirect object).\n\nVocabulary\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish mantequilla, aguacate and albaricoque (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to manteca (word used for lard in Peninsular Spanish), palta, and damasco, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except manteca), Paraguay, Peru (except manteca and damasco), and Uruguay. In the healthcare context, an assessment of the Spanish translation of the QWB-SA identified some regional vocabulary choices and US-specific concepts, which cannot be successfully implemented in Spain without adaptation.\n\nVocabulary\nAround 85% of everyday Spanish vocabulary is of Latin origin. Most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in Spanish comes from Latin. The Spanish words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly words of Latin origin. These words of Latin origin can be classified as heritage words, cultisms (learned borrowings) and semi-cultisms.\nMost of the Spanish lexicon is made up of heritage lexicon. Heritage or directly inherited words are those whose presence in the spoken language has been continued since before the differentiation of the Romance languages. Heritage words are characterized by having undergone all the phonetic changes experienced by the language. This differentiates it from the cultisms and semi-cultisms that were no longer used in the spoken language and were later reintroduced for restricted uses. Because of this, cultisms generally have not experienced some of the phonetic changes and present a different form than they would have if they had been transmitted with heritage words.\nIn the philological tradition of Spanish, cultism is called a word whose morphology very strictly follows its Greek or Latin etymological origin, without undergoing the changes that the evolution of the Spanish language followed from its origin in Vulgar Latin. The same concept also exists in other Romance languages. Reintroduced into the language for cultural, literary or scientific considerations, cultism only adapts its form to the orthographic and phonological conventions derived from linguistic evolution, but ignores the transformations that the roots and morphemes underwent in the development of the Romance language.\nIn some cases, cultisms are used to introduce technical or specialized terminology that, present in the classical language, did not appear in the Romance language due to lack of use; This is the case of many of the literary, legal and philosophical terms of classical culture, such as ataraxia (from the Greek \u1f00\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1, \"dispassion\") or legislar (built from the Latin legislator). In other cases, they construct neologisms, such as the name of most scientific disciplines.\nA semi-cultism is a word that did not evolve in the expected way, in the vernacular language (Romance language), unlike heritage words; its evolution is incomplete. Many times interrupted by cultural influences (ecclesiastical, legal, administrative, etc.). For the same reason, they maintain some features of the language of origin. Dios is a clear example of semi-cultism, where it came from the Latin Deus. It is a semi-cultism, because it maintains (without fully adapting to Castilianization, in this case) some characteristics of the Latin language\u2014the ending in -s\u2014, but, at the same time, it undergoes slight phonetic modifications (change of eu for io). Deus > Dios (instead of remaining cultist: Deus > *Deus, or becoming a heritage word: Deus > *D\u00edo). The Catholic Church influenced by stopping the natural evolution of this word, and, in this way, converted this word into a semi-cultism and unconsciously prevented it from becoming a heritage word.\nSpanish vocabulary has been influenced by several languages. As in other European languages, Classical Greek words (Hellenisms) are abundant in the terminologies of several fields, including art, science, politics, nature, etc. Its vocabulary has also been influenced by Arabic, having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula, with around 8% of its vocabulary having Arabic lexical roots. It has also been influenced by Basque, Iberian, Celtiberian, Visigothic, and other neighboring Ibero-Romance languages. Additionally, it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages, particularly other Romance languages such as French, Mozarabic, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Occitan, and Sardinian, as well as from Quechua, Nahuatl, and other indigenous languages of the Americas. In the 18th century, words taken from French referring above all to fashion, cooking and bureaucracy were added to the Spanish lexicon. In the 19th century, new loanwords were incorporated, especially from English and German, but also from Italian in areas related to music, particularly opera and cooking. In the 20th century, the pressure of English in the fields of technology, computing, science and sports was greatly accentuated.\nIn general, Latin America is more susceptible to loanwords from English or Anglicisms. For example: mouse (computer mouse) is used in Latin America, in Spain rat\u00f3n is used. This happens largely due to closer contact with the United States. For its part, Spain is known by the use of Gallicisms or words taken from neighboring France (such as the Gallicism ordenador in European Spanish, in contrast to the Anglicism computador or computadora in American Spanish).\n\nRelation to other languages\nSpanish is closely related to the other West Iberian Romance languages, including Asturian, Aragonese, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Mirandese and Portuguese. It is somewhat less similar, to varying degrees, from other members of the Romance language family. \nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. Mutual intelligibility of the written Spanish and Portuguese languages is high, lexically and grammatically. Ethnologue gives estimates of the lexical similarity between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%, although phonologically the two languages are quite dissimilar. Italian on the other hand, is phonologically similar to Spanish, while sharing lower lexical and grammatical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and French or between Spanish and Romanian is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively. Comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n\n1. In Romance etymology, Latin terms are given in the Accusative since most forms derive from this case.\n2. As in \"us very selves\", an emphatic expression.\n3. Also n\u00f3s outros in early modern Portuguese (e.g. The Lusiads), and nosoutros in Galician.\n4. Alternatively nous autres in French.\n5. noialtri in many Southern Italian dialects and languages.\n6. Medieval Catalan (e.g. Llibre dels fets).\n7. Modified with the learned suffix -ci\u00f3n.\n8. Depending on the written norm used (see Reintegrationism).\n9. From Basque esku, \"hand\" + erdi, \"half, incomplete\". This negative meaning also applies for Latin sinistra(m) (\"dark, unfortunate\").\n10. Romanian ca\u0219 (from Latin c\u0101sevs) means a type of cheese. The universal term for cheese in Romanian is br\u00e2nz\u0103 (from unknown etymology).\n\nJudaeo-Spanish\nJudaeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino, is a variety of Spanish which preserves many features of medieval Spanish and some old Portuguese and is spoken by descendants of the Sephardi Jews who were expelled from Spain in the 15th century. While in Portugal the conversion of Jews occurred earlier and the assimilation of New Christians was overwhelming, in Spain the Jews kept their language and identity. The relationship of Ladino and Spanish is therefore comparable with that of the Yiddish language to German. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively Sephardi Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America. Judaeo-Spanish lacks the Native American vocabulary which was acquired by standard Spanish during the Spanish colonial period, and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from Hebrew, French, Greek and Turkish, and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly olim (immigrants to Israel) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to assimilation by modern Spanish.\nA related dialect is Haketia, the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too, tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\nWriting system\nSpanish is written in the Latin script, with the addition of the character \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9 (e\u00f1e, representing the phoneme /\u0272/, a letter distinct from \u27e8n\u27e9, although typographically composed of an \u27e8n\u27e9 with a tilde). Formerly the digraphs \u27e8ch\u27e9 (che, representing the phoneme /t\u0361\u0283/) and \u27e8ll\u27e9 (elle, representing the phoneme /\u028e/ or /\u029d/), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph \u27e8rr\u27e9 (erre fuerte, 'strong r', erre doble, 'double r', or simply erre), which also represents a distinct phoneme /r/, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 \u27e8ch\u27e9 and \u27e8ll\u27e9 have been treated as letter pairs for collation purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with \u27e8ch\u27e9 are now alphabetically sorted between those with \u27e8cg\u27e9 and \u27e8ci\u27e9, instead of following \u27e8cz\u27e9 as they used to. The situation is similar for \u27e8ll\u27e9.\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, \u00d1, O, P, Q, R,  S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs (ch, ll, rr, gu, qu) are considered letters by the Royal Spanish Academy.\nThe letters k and w are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages (kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi, etc.).\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as M\u00e9xico (see Toponymy of Mexico), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including \u27e8y\u27e9) or with a vowel followed by \u27e8n\u27e9 or an \u27e8s\u27e9; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel.\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain homophones, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic: compare el ('the', masculine singular definite article) with \u00e9l ('he' or 'it'), or te ('you', object pronoun) with t\u00e9 ('tea'), de (preposition 'of') versus d\u00e9 ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and se (reflexive pronoun) versus s\u00e9 ('I know' or imperative 'be').\nThe interrogative pronouns (qu\u00e9, cu\u00e1l, d\u00f3nde, qui\u00e9n, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives (\u00e9se, \u00e9ste, aqu\u00e9l, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of typewriters and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\nWhen u is written between g and a front vowel e or i, it indicates a \"hard g\" pronunciation. A diaeresis \u00fc indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., cig\u00fce\u00f1a, 'stork', is pronounced [\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263we\u0272a]; if it were written *cigue\u00f1a, it would be pronounced *[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263e\u0272a]).\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with inverted question and exclamation marks (\u00bf and \u00a1, respectively) and closed by the usual question and exclamation marks.\n\nOrganizations\nRoyal Spanish Academy\nThe Royal Spanish Academy (Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola), founded in 1713, together with the 21 other national ones (see Association of Spanish Language Academies), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language (Standard Spanish) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\nAssociation of Spanish Language Academies\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies (Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola, or ASALE) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language. It was created in Mexico in 1951 and represents the union of all the separate academies in the Spanish-speaking world. It comprises the academies of 23 countries, ordered by date of academy foundation: Spain (1713), Colombia (1871), Ecuador (1874), Mexico (1875), El Salvador (1876), Venezuela (1883), Chile (1885), Peru (1887), Guatemala (1887), Costa Rica (1923), Philippines (1924), Panama (1926), Cuba (1926),\nParaguay (1927), Dominican Republic (1927), Bolivia (1927), Nicaragua (1928), Argentina (1931), Uruguay (1943), Honduras (1949), Puerto Rico (1955), United States (1973) and Equatorial Guinea (2016).\n\nCervantes Institute\nThe Instituto Cervantes ('Cervantes Institute') is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branches in 45 countries, with 88 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The institute's 2015 report \"El espa\u00f1ol, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"El espa\u00f1ol en el mundo 2018\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.\n\nOfficial use by international organizations\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the African Union, the Union of South American Nations, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, the Latin Union, the Caricom, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Inter-American Development Bank, and numerous other international organizations.\n\nSample text\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Spanish:\n\nTodos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como est\u00e1n de raz\u00f3n y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English:\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Here is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article on the Spanish language:\n\n1. **Grammar:**\n   - **Noun and Adjective Systems:** Spanish has two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). Articles and some pronouns and determiners have a neuter gender in their singular form.\n   - **Verb Conjugation:** Spanish verbs have about fifty conjugated forms, with three tenses (past, present, future), two aspects for past (perfective, imperfective), four moods (indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative), three persons (first, second, third), and two numbers (singular, plural). There are also three verboid forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle.\n   - **T-V Distinction:** Verbs express formal and informal addresses using different persons.\n   - **Syntax:** Spanish is a right-branching language, typically using a subject-verb-object order, but this can vary due to topicalization and focus. It is a \"pro-drop\" language, allowing the deletion of subject pronouns when unnecessary.\n   - **Verb-Framed Language:** Direction of motion is expressed in the verb, while the mode of locomotion is expressed adverbially.\n\n2. **Phonology:**\n   - **Vowels and Consonants:** Spanish has five vowel phonemes (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes, depending on the dialect. The high vowels /i/ and /u/ reduce to glides [j] and [w] when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel.\n   - **Consonant System:** Includes three nasal phonemes, one or two lateral phonemes, three voiceless stops, the affricate /t\u0283/, three or four voiceless fricatives, and a set of voiced obstruents (/b/, /d/, /\u0261/, and sometimes /\u029d/) that alternate between approximant and plosive allophones.\n   - **Stress and Intonation:** Spanish is syllable-timed, with stress typically on the penultimate syllable unless indicated by an accent mark. Intonation varies by dialect but generally follows a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and rising tone for yes/no questions.\n\n3. **Morphology:**\n   - **Pronouns:** Spanish uses different pronouns for formal and informal second-person singular (usted, t\u00fa, vos) and plural (ustedes, vosotros) forms. The use of vos and its verb forms is called voseo.\n   - **Voseo:** Involves using vos as the subject form and has distinct verb conjugations, especially in the present tense.\n   - **Ustedes and Usted:** Ustedes is used for both formal and informal second-person plural in most of the Spanish-speaking world, while usted is used for formal second-person singular.\n\n4. **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Latin Origin:** Around 85% of everyday Spanish vocabulary is of Latin origin, with words classified as heritage words, cultisms, and semi-cultisms.\n   - **Loanwords:** Spanish has absorbed vocabulary from Arabic, Basque, Iberian, Celtiberian, Visigothic, and other Romance languages, as well as from indigenous languages of the Americas.\n   - **Regional Variations:** Vocabulary can vary significantly between different Spanish-speaking regions, with some words having different meanings or usage.\n\n5. **Writing System:**\n   - **Alphabet:** The Spanish alphabet consists of 27 letters, including the unique letter \u00f1. The digraphs ch and ll were formerly considered single letters but are now treated as letter pairs.\n   - **Accent Marks:** Used to indicate stress and distinguish between homophones. Interrogative and exclamatory clauses use inverted question and exclamation marks (\u00bf and \u00a1).\n\n6. **Dialectal Variation:**\n   - **Phonological Differences:** Variations include the presence or absence of the phoneme /\u03b8/, debuccalization of syllable-final /s/, and the sound of the spelled \u27e8s\u27e9.\n   - **Morphological Differences:** Involve differing uses of pronouns and verb forms, particularly with voseo and the use of ustedes and usted.\n\n7. **Organizations:**\n   - **Royal Spanish Academy (RAE):** Provides standardization through dictionaries and grammar guides.\n   - **Association of Spanish Language Academies (ASALE):** Regulates the Spanish language across 23 countries.\n   - **Cervantes Institute:** Promotes Spanish language and culture worldwide.\n\nUnderstanding these aspects of Spanish will greatly aid in translating text into the language accurately and effectively.", "updated": "2025-03-04T16:55:30.808014"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levantine_Arabic": {"base_content": "Levantine Arabic, also called Shami (autonym: \u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a, \u0161\u0101mi or \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629, el-lahje \u0161-\u0161\u0101miyye), is an Arabic variety spoken in the Levant, namely in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel and southern Turkey (historically only in Adana, Mersin and Hatay provinces). With over 60 million speakers, Levantine is, alongside Egyptian, one of the two prestige varieties of spoken Arabic comprehensible all over the Arab world.\nLevantine is not officially recognized in any state or territory. Although it is the majority language in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, it is predominantly used as a spoken vernacular in daily communication, whereas most written and official documents and media in these countries use the official Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), a form of literary Arabic only acquired through formal education that does not function as a native language. In Israel and Turkey, Levantine is a minority language.\nThe Palestinian dialect is lexically the closest vernacular Arabic variety to MSA, with about 50% of common words. Nevertheless, Levantine and MSA are not mutually intelligible. Levantine speakers therefore often call their language \u200f\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629\u200e al-\u02bf\u0101mmiyya , 'slang', 'dialect', or 'colloquial'. With the emergence of social media, attitudes toward Levantine have improved. The amount of written Levantine has significantly increased, especially online, where Levantine is written using Arabic, Latin, or Hebrew characters. Levantine pronunciation varies greatly along social, ethnic, and geographical lines. Its grammar is similar to that shared by most vernacular varieties of Arabic. Its lexicon is overwhelmingly Arabic, with a significant Aramaic influence.\nThe lack of written sources in Levantine makes it impossible to determine its history before the modern period. Aramaic was the dominant language in the Levant starting in the 1st millennium BCE; it coexisted with other languages, including many Arabic dialects spoken by various Arab tribes. With the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, new Arabic speakers from the Arabian Peninsula settled in the area, and a lengthy language shift from Aramaic to vernacular Arabic occurred.\n\nNaming and classification\nScholars use \"Levantine Arabic\" to describe the continuum of mutually intelligible dialects spoken across the Levant. Other terms include \"Syro-Palestinian\", \"Eastern Arabic\", \"East Mediterranean Arabic\", \"Syro-Lebanese\" (as a broad term covering Jordan and Palestine as well), \"Greater Syrian\", or \"Syrian Arabic\" (in a broad meaning, referring to all the dialects of Greater Syria, which corresponds to the Levant). Most authors only include sedentary dialects, excluding Bedouin dialects of the Syrian Desert and the Negev, which belong to the dialects of the Arabian Peninsula. Mesopotamian dialects from northeast Syria are also excluded. Other authors include Bedouin varieties.\nThe term \"Levantine Arabic\" is not indigenous and, according to linguists Kristen Brustad and Emilie Zuniga, \"it is likely that many speakers would resist the grouping on the basis that the rich phonological, morphological and lexical variation within the Levant carries important social meanings and distinctions.\" Levantine speakers often call their language \u200f\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629\u200e al-\u02bf\u0101mmiyya, 'slang', 'dialect', or 'colloquial' (lit.\u2009'the language of common people'), to contrast it to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Classical Arabic (\u200f\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u062d\u0649\u200e al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101, lit.\u2009'the eloquent'). They also call their spoken language \u200f\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u200e \u02bfarabiyy, 'Arabic'. Alternatively, they identify their language by the name of their country. \u200f\u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a\u200e \u0161\u0101mi can refer to Damascus Arabic, Syrian Arabic, or Levantine as a whole. Lebanese literary figure Said Akl led a movement to recognize the \"Lebanese language\" as a distinct prestigious language instead of MSA.\nLevantine is a variety of Arabic, a Semitic language. There is no consensus regarding the genealogical position of Arabic within the Semitic languages. The position of Levantine and other Arabic vernaculars in the Arabic macrolanguage family has also been contested. According to the Arabic tradition, Classical Arabic was the spoken language of the pre-Islamic and Early Islamic periods and remained stable until today's MSA. According to this view, all Arabic vernaculars, including Levantine, descend from Classical Arabic and were corrupted by contacts with other languages. Several Arabic varieties are closer to other Semitic languages and maintain features not found in Classical Arabic, indicating that these varieties cannot have developed from Classical Arabic. Thus, Arabic vernaculars are not a modified version of the Classical language, which is a sister language rather than their direct ancestor. Classical Arabic and vernacular varieties all developed from an unattested common ancestor, Proto-Arabic. The ISO 639-3 standard classifies Levantine as a language, member of the macrolanguage Arabic.\nSedentary vernaculars (also called dialects) are traditionally classified into five groups according to shared features: Peninsular, Mesopotamian, Levantine, Egyptian, and Maghrebi. The linguistic distance between these vernaculars is at least as large as between Germanic languages or Romance languages. It is, for instance, extremely difficult for Moroccans and Iraqis, each speaking their own variety, to understand each other. Levantine and Egyptian are the two prestige varieties of spoken Arabic; they are also the most widely understood dialects in the Arab world and the most commonly taught to non-native speakers outside the Arab world.\n\nGeographical distribution and varieties\nDialects\nLevantine is spoken in the fertile strip on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean: from the Turkish coastal provinces of Adana, Hatay, and Mersin in the north to the Negev, passing through Lebanon, the coastal regions of Syria (Latakia and Tartus governorates) as well as around Aleppo and Damascus, the Hauran in Syria and Jordan, the rest of western Jordan, Palestine and Israel. Other Arabic varieties border it: Mesopotamian and North Mesopotamian Arabic to the north and north-east; Najdi Arabic to the east and south-east; and Northwest Arabian Arabic to the south and south-west.\nThe similarity among Levantine dialects transcends geographical location and political boundaries. The urban dialects of the main cities (such as Damascus, Beirut, and Jerusalem) have much more in common with each other than they do with the rural dialects of their respective countries. The sociolects of two different social or religious groups within the same country may also show more dissimilarity with each other than when compared with their counterparts in another country.\nThe process of linguistic homogenization within each country of the Levant makes a classification of dialects by country possible today. Linguist Kees Versteegh classifies Levantine into three groups: Lebanese/Central Syrian (including Beirut, Damascus, Druze Arabic, Cypriot Maronite), North Syrian (including Aleppo), and Palestinian/Jordanian. He writes that distinctions between these groups are unclear, and isoglosses cannot determine the exact boundary.\n\nThe dialect of Aleppo shows Mesopotamian influence. The prestige dialect of Damascus is the most documented Levantine dialect. A \"common Syrian Arabic\" is emerging. Similarly, a \"Standard Lebanese Arabic\" is emerging, combining features of Beiruti Arabic (which is not prestigious) and Jabale Arabic, the language of Mount Lebanon. In \u00c7ukurova, Turkey, the local dialect is endangered. Bedouin varieties are spoken in the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula, areas of transition between Levantine and Egyptian. The dialect of Arish, Egypt, is classified by Linguasphere as Levantine. The Amman dialect is emerging as an urban standard in Jordanian Arabic, while other Jordanian and Palestinian Arabic dialects include Fellahi (rural) and Madani (urban). The Gaza dialect contains features of both urban Palestinian and Bedouin Arabic.\n\nEthnicity and religion\nThe Levant is characterized by ethnic diversity and religious pluralism. Levantine dialects vary along sectarian lines. Religious groups include Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, Alawites, Christians, Druze, and Jews. Differences between Muslim and Christian dialects are minimal, mainly involving some religious vocabulary. A minority of features are perceived as typically associated with one group. For example, in Beirut, the exponent \u200f\u062a\u0627\u0639\u200e t\u0113\u0295 is only used by Muslims and never by Christians who use \u200f\u062a\u0628\u0639\u200e taba\u0295. Contrary to others, Druze and Alawite dialects retained the phoneme /q/. MSA influences Sunni dialects more. Jewish dialects diverge more from Muslim dialects and often show influences from other towns due to trade networks and contacts with other Jewish communities. For instance, the Jewish dialect of Hatay is very similar to the Aleppo dialect, particularly the dialect of the Jews of Aleppo. It shows traits otherwise not found in any dialect of Hatay. Koineization in cities such as Damascus leads to a homogenization of the language among religious groups. In contrast, the marginalization of Christians in Jordan intensifies linguistic differences between Christian Arabs and Muslims.\nLevantine is primarily spoken by Arabs. It is also spoken as a first or second language by several ethnic minorities. In particular, it is spoken natively by Samaritans and by most Circassians in Jordan, Armenians in Jordan and Israel, Assyrians in Israel, Turkmen in Syria and Lebanon, Kurds in Lebanon, and Dom people in Jerusalem. Most Christian and Muslim Lebanese people in Israel speak Lebanese Arabic. Syrian Jews, Lebanese Jews, and Turkish Jews from \u00c7ukurova are native Levantine speakers; however, most moved to Israel after 1948. Levantine was spoken natively by most Jews in Jerusalem, but the community shifted to Modern Hebrew after the establishment of Israel. Levantine is the second language of Dom people across the Levant, Circassians in Israel, Armenians in Lebanon, Chechens in Jordan, Assyrians in Syria and Lebanon, and most Kurds in Syria.\n\nSpeakers by country\nIn addition to the Levant, where it is indigenous, Levantine is spoken among diaspora communities from the region, especially among the Palestinian, Lebanese, and Syrian diasporas. The language has fallen into disuse among subsequent diaspora generations, such as the 7 million Lebanese Brazilians.\n\nHistory\nPre-Islamic antiquity\nStarting in the 1st millennium BCE, Aramaic was the dominant spoken language and the language of writing and administration in the Levant. Greek was the language of administration of the Seleucid Empire (in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and was maintained by the Roman (64 BCE\u2013475 CE), then Byzantine (476\u2013640) empires. From the early 1st millennium BCE until the 6th century CE, there was a continuum of Central Semitic languages in the Arabian Peninsula, and Central Arabia was home to languages quite distinct from Arabic.\nBecause there are no written sources, the history of Levantine before the modern period is unknown. Old Arabic was a dialect continuum stretching from the southern Levant (where Northern Old Arabic was spoken) to the northern Hijaz, in the Arabian Peninsula, where Old Hijazi was spoken. In the early 1st century CE, a great variety of Arabic dialects were already spoken by various nomadic or semi-nomadic Arabic tribes in the Levant, such as the Nabataeans\u2014who used Aramaic for official purposes, the Tanukhids, and the Ghassanids. These dialects were local, coming from the Hauran\u2014and not from the Arabian Peninsula\u2014 and related to later Classical Arabic. Initially restricted to the steppe, Arabic-speaking nomads started to settle in cities and fertile areas after the Plague of Justinian in 542 CE. These Arab communities stretched from the southern extremities of the Syrian Desert to central Syria, the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, and the Beqaa Valley.\n\nMuslim conquest of the Levant\nThe Muslim conquest of the Levant (634\u2013640) brought new groups of Arabic speakers from the Arabian Peninsula who settled in the Levant. Arabic became the language of trade and public life in cities, while Western Aramaic languages continued to be spoken at home and in the countryside. Arabic gradually replaced early Medieval Greek as the language of administration in 700 by order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. The language shift from Aramaic to vernacular Arabic was a long process over several generations, with an extended period of multilingualism, especially among non-Muslims. Christians continued to speak Syriac for about two centuries, and Syriac remained their literary language until the 14th century. In its spoken form, Aramaic nearly disappeared, except for a few Western Neo-Aramaic-speaking villages, but it has left substrate influences on Levantine.\nDifferent Peninsular Arabic dialects competed for prestige in the Levant, including the Old Hijazi Arabic of the Umayyad elites. These Peninsular dialects mixed with ancient Levantine forms of Arabic. By the mid-6th century, the Petra papyri show that the onset of the article and its vowel seem to have weakened. The article is sometimes written as /el-/ or simply /l-/. A similar, but not identical, situation is found in the texts from the Islamic period. Unlike the pre-Islamic attestations, the coda of the article in 'conquest Arabic' assimilates to a following coronal consonant. According to Pr. Simon Hopkins, this document shows that there is \"a very impressive continuity in colloquial Arabic usage, and the roots of the modern vernaculars are thus seen to lie very deep\".\n\nMedieval and early modern era\nThe Damascus Psalm Fragment, dated to the 9th century but possibly earlier, sheds light on the Damascus dialect of that period. Because its Arabic text is written in Greek characters, it reveals the pronunciation of the time; it features many examples of im\u0101la (the fronting and raising of /a/ toward /i/). It also features a pre-grammarian standard of Arabic and the dialect from which it sprung, likely Old Hijazi. Scholars disagree on the dates of phonological changes. The shift of interdental spirants to dental stops dates to the 9th to 10th centuries or earlier. The shift from /q/ to a glottal stop is dated between the 11th and 15th centuries. Im\u0101la seems already important in pre-Islamic times.\nSwedish orientalist Carlo Landberg writes about the vulgarisms encountered in Damascene poet Usama ibn Munqidh's Memoirs: \"All of them are found in today's spoken language of Syria and it is very interesting to note that that language is, on the whole, not very different from the language of \u02c0Us\u0101ma's days\", in the 12th century. Lucas Caballero's Compendio (1709) describes spoken Damascene Arabic in the early 1700s. It corresponds to modern Damascene in some respects, such as the allomorphic variation between -a/-e in the feminine suffix. On the contrary, the insertion and deletion of vowels differ from the modern dialect.\nFrom 1516 to 1918, the Ottoman Empire dominated the Levant. Many Western words entered Arabic through Ottoman Turkish as it was the main language for transmitting Western ideas into the Arab world.\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nThe dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century reduced the use of Turkish words due to Arabization and the negative perception of the Ottoman era among Arabs. With the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon (1920\u20131946), the British protectorate over Jordan (1921\u20131946), and the British Mandate for Palestine (1923\u20131948), French and English words gradually entered Levantine Arabic. Similarly, Modern Hebrew has significantly influenced the Palestinian dialect of Arab Israelis since the establishment of Israel in 1948. In the 1960s, Said Akl\u2014inspired by the Maltese and Turkish alphabets\u2014 designed a new Latin alphabet for Lebanese and promoted the official use of Lebanese instead of MSA, but this movement was unsuccessful.\nAlthough Levantine dialects have remained stable over the past two centuries, in cities such as Amman and Damascus, language standardization occurs through variant reduction and linguistic homogenization among the various religious groups and neighborhoods. Urbanization and the increasing proportion of youth constitute the causes of dialect change. Urban forms are considered more prestigious, and prestige dialects of the capitals are replacing the rural varieties. With the emergence of social media, the amount of written Levantine has also significantly increased online.\n\nStatus and usage\nDiglossia and code-switching\nLevantine is not recognized in any state or territory. MSA is the sole official language in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria; it has a \"special status\" in Israel under the Basic Law. French is also recognized in Lebanon. In Turkey, the only official language is Turkish. Any variation from MSA is considered a \"dialect\" of Arabic. As in the rest of the Arab world, this linguistic situation has been described as diglossia: MSA is nobody's first acquired language; it is learned through formal instruction rather than transmission from parent to child. This diglossia has been compared to the use of Latin as the sole written, official, liturgical, and literary language in Europe during the medieval period, while Romance languages were the spoken languages. Levantine and MSA are mutually unintelligible. They differ significantly in their phonology, morphology, lexicon and syntax.\nMSA is the language of literature, official documents, and formal written media (newspapers, instruction leaflets, school books). In spoken form, MSA is mostly used when reading from a scripted text (e.g., news bulletins) and for prayer and sermons in the mosque or church. In Israel, Hebrew is the language used in the public sphere, except internally among the Arab communities. Levantine is the usual medium of communication in all other domains.\nTraditionally in the Arab world, colloquial varieties, such as Levantine, have been regarded as corrupt forms of MSA, less eloquent and not fit for literature, and thus looked upon with disdain. Because the French and the British emphasized vernaculars when they colonized the Arab world, dialects were also seen as a tool of colonialism and imperialism. Writing in the vernacular has been controversial because pan-Arab nationalists consider that this might divide the Arab people into different nations. On the other hand, Classical Arabic is seen as \"the language of the Quran\" and revered by Muslims who form the majority of the population. It is believed to be pure and everlasting, and Islamic religious ideology considers vernaculars to be inferior. Until recently, the use of Levantine in formal settings or written form was often ideologically motivated, for instance in opposition to pan-Arabism. Language attitudes are shifting, and using Levantine became de-ideologized for most speakers by the late 2010s. Levantine is now regarded in a more positive light, and its use in informal modes of writing is acknowledged, thanks to its recent widespread use online in both written and spoken forms.\nCode-switching between Levantine, MSA, English, French (in Lebanon and among Arab Christians in Syria), and Hebrew (in Israel) is frequent among Levantine speakers, in both informal and formal settings (such as on television). Gordon cites two Lebanese examples: \"Bonjour, ya habibti, how are you?\" (\"Hello, my love, how are you?\") and \"Oui, but leish?\" (\"Yes, but why?\"). Code-switching also happens in politics. For instance, not all politicians master MSA in Lebanon, so they rely on Lebanese. Many public and formal speeches and most political talk shows are in Lebanese instead of MSA. In Israel, Arabic and Hebrew are allowed in the Knesset, but Arabic is rarely used. MK Ahmad Tibi often adds Palestinian Arabic sentences to his Hebrew speech but only gives partial speeches in Arabic.\n\nEducation\nIn the Levant, MSA is the only variety authorized for use in schools, although in practice, lessons are often taught in a mix of MSA and Levantine with, for instance, the lesson read out in MSA and explained in Levantine. In Lebanon, about 50% of school students study in French. In most Arab universities, the medium of instruction is MSA in social sciences and humanities, and English or French in the applied and medical sciences. In Syria, only MSA is used. In Turkey, article 42.9 of the Constitution prohibits languages other than Turkish from being taught as a mother tongue and almost all indigenous Arabic speakers are illiterate in the Arabic script unless they have learned it for religious purposes.\nIn Israel, MSA is the only language of instruction in Arab schools. Hebrew is studied as a second language by all Palestinian students from at least the second grade and English from the third grade. In Jewish schools, in 2012, 23,000 pupils were studying spoken Palestinian in 800 elementary schools. Palestinian Arabic is compulsory in Jewish elementary schools in the Northern District; otherwise, Jewish schools teach MSA. Junior high schools must teach all students MSA, but only two-thirds meet this obligation. At all stages in 2012, 141,000 Jewish students were learning Arabic. In 2020, 3.7% of Jewish students took the Bagrut exam in MSA.\n\nFilms and music\nMost films and songs are in vernacular Arabic. Egypt was the most influential center of Arab media productions (movies, drama, TV series) during the 20th century, but Levantine is now competing with Egyptian. As of 2013, about 40% of all music production in the Arab world was in Lebanese. Lebanese television is the oldest and largest private Arab broadcast industry. Most big-budget pan-Arab entertainment shows are filmed in the Lebanese dialect in the studios of Beirut. Moreover, the Syrian dialect dominates in Syrian TV series (such as Bab Al-Hara) and in the dubbing of Turkish television dramas (such as Noor), famous across the Arab world.\nAs of 2009, most Arabic satellite television networks use colloquial varieties in their programs, except news bulletins in MSA. The use of vernacular in broadcasting started in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War and expanded to the rest of the Arab world. In 2009, Al Jazeera used MSA only and Al Arabiya and Al-Manar used MSA or a hybrid between MSA and colloquial for talk shows. On the popular Lebanese satellite channel Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (LBCI), Arab and international news bulletins are only in MSA, while the Lebanese national news broadcast is in a mix of MSA and Lebanese Arabic.\n\nWritten media\nLevantine is seldom written, except for some novels, plays, and humorous writings. Most Arab critics do not acknowledge the literary dignity of prose in dialect. Prose written in Lebanese goes back to at least 1892 when Tannus al-Hurr published Riw\u0101yat a\u0161-\u0161\u0101bb as-sikk\u012br \u02beay Qi\u1e63\u1e63at Na\u1e63\u1e63\u016br as-Sikr\u012b, 'The tale of the drunken youth, or The story of Nassur the Drunkard'. In the 1960s, Said Akl led a movement in Lebanon to replace MSA as the national and literary language, and a handful of writers wrote in Lebanese. Foreign works, such as La Fontaine's Fables, were translated into Lebanese using Akl's alphabet. The Gospel of Mark was published in Palestinian in 1940, followed by the Gospel of Matthew and the Letter of James in 1946. The four gospels were translated in Lebanese using Akl's alphabet in 1996 by Gilbert Khalif\u00e9. Muris 'Awwad translated the four gospels and The Little Prince in 2001 in Lebanese in Arabic script. The Little Prince was also translated into Palestinian and published in two biscriptal editions (one Arabic/Hebrew script, one Arabic/Latin script).\nNewspapers usually use MSA and reserve Levantine for sarcastic commentaries and caricatures. Headlines in Levantine are common. The letter to the editor section often includes entire paragraphs in Levantine. Many newspapers also regularly publish personal columns in Levantine, such as \u062e\u0631\u0645 \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0629 xurm \u02beibra, lit.\u2009'[through the] needle's eye' in the weekend edition of Al-Ayyam. From 1983 to 1990, Said Akl's newspaper Lebnaan was published in Lebanese written in the Latin alphabet. Levantine is also commonly used in zajal and other forms of oral poetry. Zajal written in vernacular was published in Lebanese newspapers such as Al-Mashriq (\"The Levant\", from 1898) and Ad-Dabbur (\"The Hornet\", from 1925). In the 1940s, five reviews in Beirut were dedicated exclusively to poetry in Lebanese. In a 2013 study, Abuhakema investigated 270 written commercial ads in two Jordanian (Al Ghad and Ad-Dustour) and two Palestinian (Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam) daily newspapers. The study concluded that MSA is still the most used variety in ads, although both varieties are acceptable and Levantine is increasingly used.\nMost comedies are written in Levantine. In Syria, plays became more common and popular in the 1980s by using Levantine instead of Classical Arabic. Saadallah Wannous, the most renowned Syrian playwright, used Syrian Arabic in his later plays. Comic books, like the Syrian comic strip K\u016bkt\u012bl, are often written in Levantine instead of MSA. In novels and short stories, most authors, such as Arab Israelis Riyad Baydas and Odeh Bisharat, write the dialogues in their Levantine dialect, while the rest of the text is in MSA. Lebanese authors Elias Khoury (especially in his recent works) and Kahlil Gibran wrote the main narrative in Levantine. Some collections of short stories and anthologies of Palestinian folktales (tur\u0101\u1e6f, 'heritage literature') display full texts in dialect. On the other hand, Palestinian children's literature is almost exclusively written in MSA.\nInternet users in the Arab world communicate with their dialect language (such as Levantine) more than MSA on social media (such as Twitter, Facebook, or in the comments of online newspapers). According to one study, between 12% and 23% of all dialectal Arabic content online was written in Levantine depending on the platform.\n\nPhonology\nLevantine phonology is characterized by rich socio-phonetic variations along socio-cultural (gender; religion; urban, rural or Bedouin) and geographical lines. For instance, in urban varieties, interdentals /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/, and /\u00f0\u0295/ tend to merge to stops or fricatives [t] ~ [s]; [d] ~ [z]; and [d\u0295] ~ [z\u0295] respectively. The Classical Arabic voiceless uvular plosive /q/ is pronounced [q] (among Druze), [\u0294] (in most urban centers, especially Beirut, Damascus, and Jerusalem, and in Amman among women), [\u0261] (in Amman among men, in most other Jordanian dialects and in Gaza), [k] or even /k\u0295/ (in rural Palestinian).\n\nVowel length is phonemic in Levantine. Vowels often show dialectal or allophonic variations that are socially, geographically, and phonologically conditioned. Diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/ are found in some Lebanese dialects, they respectively correspond to long vowels /e\u02d0/ and /o\u02d0/ in other dialects. One of the most distinctive features of Levantine is word-final im\u0101la, a process by which the vowel corresponding to \u0629 t\u0101\u02bc marb\u016b\u1e6dah is raised from [a] to [\u00e6], [\u025b], [e] or even [i] in some dialects. The difference between the short vowel pairs e and i as well as o and u is not always phonemic. The vowel quality is usually i and u in stressed syllables. Vowels in word-final position are shortened. As a result, more short vowels are distinguished.\nIn the north, stressed i and u merge. They usually become i, but might also be u near emphatic consonants. Syrians and Beirutis tend to pronounce both of them as schwa [\u0259]. The long vowel \"\u0101\" is pronounced similar to \"\u0113\" or even merges with \"\u0113\", when it is not near an emphatic or guttural consonant.\n\nSyllabification and phonotactics are complex, even within a single dialect. Speakers often add a short vowel, called helping vowel or epenthetic vowel, sounding like a short schwa right before a word-initial consonant cluster to break it, as in kti\u02d0r \u01ddmni\u02d0\u0127, 'very good/well'. They are not considered part of the word and are never stressed. This process of anaptyxis is subject to social and regional variation. They are usually not written. A helping vowel is inserted:\n\nBefore the word, if this word starts with two consonants and is at the beginning of a sentence,\nBetween two words, when a word ending in a consonant is followed by a word that starts with two consonants,\nBetween two consonants in the same word, if this word ends with two consonants and either is followed by a consonant or is at the end of a sentence.\nIn the Damascus dialect, word stress falls on the last superheavy syllable (CV\u02d0C or CVCC). In the absence of a superheavy syllable:\n\nif the word is bisyllabic, stress falls on the penultimate,\nif the word contains three or more syllables and none of them is superheavy, then stress falls:\non the penultimate, if it is heavy (CV\u02d0 or CVC),\non the antepenult, if the penultimate is light (CV).\n\nOrthography and writing systems\nUntil recently, Levantine was rarely written. Brustad and Zuniga report that in 1988, they did not find anything published in Levantine in Syria. By the late 2010s, written Levantine was used in many public venues and on the internet, especially social media. There is no standard Levantine orthography. There have been failed attempts to Latinize Levantine, especially Lebanese. For instance, Said Akl promoted a modified Latin alphabet. Akl used this alphabet to write books and publish a newspaper, Lebnaan.\nWritten communication takes place using a variety of orthographies and writing systems, including Arabic (right-to-left script), Hebrew (right-to-left, used in Israel, especially online among Bedouin, Arab Christians, and Druze), Latin (Arabizi, left-to-right), and a mixture of the three. Arabizi is a non-standard romanization used by Levantine speakers in social media and discussion forums, SMS messaging, and online chat. Arabizi initially developed because the Arabic script was not available or not easy to use on most computers and smartphones; its usage declined after Arabic software became widespread. According to a 2020 survey done in Nazareth, Arabizi \"emerged\" as a \"'bottom-up' orthography\" and there is now \"a high degree of normativization or standardisation in Arabizi orthography.\" Among consonants, only five (\u062c ,\u0630 ,\u0636 ,\u0638 ,\u0642) revealed variability in their Arabizi representation.\nA 2012 study found that on the Jordanian forum Mahjoob about one-third of messages were written in Levantine in the Arabic script, one-third in Arabizi, and one-third in English. Another 2012 study found that on Facebook, the Arabic script was dominant in Syria, while the Latin script dominated in Lebanon. Both scripts were used in Palestine, Israel, and Jordan. Several factors affect script choice: formality (the Arabic script is more formal), ethnicity and religion (Muslims use the Arabic script more while Israeli Druze and Bedouins prefer Hebrew characters), age (young use Latin more), education (educated people write more in Latin), and script congruence (the tendency to reply to a post in the same script). Levantine speakers in Turkey use the Latin-based Turkish alphabet.\n\nThe Arabic alphabet is always cursive, and letters vary in shape depending on their position within a word. Letters exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position (IMFI). Only the isolated form is shown in the tables below. In the Arabic script, short vowels are not represented by letters but by diacritics above or below the letters. When Levantine is written with the Arabic script, short vowels are usually only indicated if a word is ambiguous. In the Arabic script, a shadda above a consonant doubles it. In Latin alphabet, the consonant is written twice: \u200f\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0633\u0629\u200e, mudarrise, 'a female teacher' / \u200f\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629\u200e, madrase, 'a school'. Said Akl's Latin alphabet uses non-standard characters.\n\nGrammar\nVSO and SVO word orders are possible in Levantine. In both cases, the verb precedes the object. SVO is more common in Levantine, while Classical Arabic prefers VSO. Subject-initial order indicates topic-prominent sentences, while verb-initial order indicates subject-prominent sentences. In interrogative sentences, the interrogative particle comes first.\n\nNouns and noun phrases\nNouns are either masculine or feminine and singular, dual or plural. The dual is formed with the suffix \u064a\u0646- -\u0113n. Most feminine singular nouns end with \u0640\u0629 t\u0101\u02bc marb\u016b\u1e6dah, pronounced as \u2013a or -e depending on the preceding consonant: -a after guttural (\u062d \u062e \u0639 \u063a \u0642 \u0647 \u0621) and emphatic consonants (\u0631 \u0635 \u0636 \u0637 \u0638), -e after other consonants. Unlike Classical Arabic, Levantine has no case marking.\nLevantine has a definite article, which marks common nouns (i.e. nouns that are not proper nouns) as definite. Its absence marks common nouns as indefinite.  The Arabic definite article \u0627\u0644 il precedes the noun or adjective and has multiple pronunciations. Its vowel is dropped when the preceding word ends in a vowel. A helping vowel \"e\" is inserted if the following word begins with a consonant cluster. It assimilates with \"sun letters\" (consonants that are pronounced with the tip of the tongue). The letter Jeem (\u062c) is a sun letter for speakers pronouncing it as [\u0292] but not for those pronouncing it as [d\u0361\u0292].\nFor nouns referring to humans, the regular (also called sound) masculine plural is formed with the suffix -\u012bn. The regular feminine plural is formed with -\u0101t. The masculine plural is used to refer to a group with both genders. There are many broken plurals (also called internal plurals), in which the consonantal root of the singular is changed. These plural patterns are shared with other varieties of Arabic and may also be applied to foreign borrowings. Several patterns of broken plurals exist, and it is impossible to predict them exactly. One common pattern is for instance CvCvC => CuCaCa (e.g.: singular: \u200f\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0631\u200e mud\u012br, 'manager'; plural: \u200f\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0627\u200e mudara, 'managers'). Inanimate objects take feminine singular agreement in the plural, for verbs, attached pronouns, and adjectives.\nThe genitive is formed by putting the nouns next to each other in a construct called i\u1e0d\u0101fah, lit.\u2009'addition'. The first noun is always indefinite. If an indefinite noun is added to a definite noun, it results in a new definite compound noun: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0630 kt\u0101b il-\u02beist\u0101z , 'the book of the teacher'. Besides possessiveness, the i\u1e0d\u0101fah can also specify or define the first term. Although there is no limit to the number of nouns in an i\u1e0d\u0101fah, it is rare to have three or more. The first term must be in the construct state: if it ends in the feminine marker (/-ah/, or /-ih/), it changes to (/-at/, /-it/) in pronunciation (i.e. \u0629 pronounced as /t/): \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0643 mad\u012bnet ny\u016b-y\u014drk , 'New York City'.\nAdjectives typically have three forms: a masculine singular, a feminine singular, and a plural. In most adjectives, the feminine is formed through the addition of -a/e. Many adjectives have the pattern \u0641\u0639\u064a\u0644 (f\u0295\u012bl / CC\u012bC or fa\u0295\u012bl / CaC\u012bC), but other patterns exist. Adjectives derived from nouns using the suffix \u0640\u064a -i are called nisba adjectives. Their feminine form ends in \u0640\u064a\u0629 -iyye and their plural in \u0640\u064a\u064a\u0646 -iyy\u012bn. Nouns in dual have adjectives in plural. The plural of adjectives is either regular ending in \u0640\u064a\u0646 -\u012bn or is an irregular \"broken\" plural. It is used with nouns referring to people. For non-human, inanimate, or abstract nouns, adjectives use either the plural or the singular feminine form regardless of gender.\nAdjectives follow the noun they modify and agree with it in definiteness. Adjectives without an article after a definite noun express a clause with the invisible copula \"to be\":\n\n\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 b\u0113t kb\u012br , 'a big house'\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 il-b\u0113t le-kb\u012br , 'the big house'\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 il-b\u0113t kb\u012br , 'the house is big'\nThe elative is used for comparison, instead of separate comparative and superlative forms. The elative is formed by adding a hamza at the beginning of the adjective and replacing the vowels by \"a\" (pattern: \u0623\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u02beaf\u0295al / aCCaC, e.g.: \u200f\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u200e kb\u012br, 'big'; \u200f\u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631\u200e \u02beakbar, 'bigger/biggest'). Adjective endings in \u200f\u064a\u200e (i) and \u200f\u0648\u200e (u) are changed into \u200f\u06cc\u200e (a). If the second and third consonant in the root are the same, they are geminated (pattern: \u0623\u0641\u0644\u0651 \u02beafall / \u02beaCaCC). When an elative modifies a noun, it precedes the noun, and no definite article is used.\nLevantine does not distinguish between adverbs and adjectives in adverbial function. Almost any adjective can be used as an adverb: \u200f\u0645\u0646\u064a\u062d\u200e mn\u012b\u1e25, 'good' vs. \u0646\u0645\u062a\u064a \u0645\u0646\u064a\u062d\u061f nimti mn\u012b\u1e25? , 'Did you sleep well?'. MSA adverbs, with the suffix -an, are often used, e.g., \u200f\u0623\u0628\u062f\u0627\u200e \u02beabadan, 'at all'. Adverbs often appear after the verb or the adjective. \u200f\u0643\u062a\u064a\u0631\u200e kt\u012br, 'very' can be positioned after or before the adjective. Adverbs of manner can usually be formed using bi- followed by the nominal form: \u200f\u0628\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629\u200e b-sir\u02bfa, 'fast, quickly', lit.\u2009'with speed'.\n\u200f\u0645\u0634\u200e mi\u0161 or in Syrian Arabic \u200f\u0645\u0648\u200e m\u016b negate adjectives (including active participles), demonstratives, and nominal phrases:\n\n\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0634 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a. \u02beana mi\u0161 falas\u1e6d\u012bni. , 'I'm not Palestinian.'\n\u0645\u0634 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641\u0629. mi\u0161 \u0295\u0101rfe. , 'She doesn't know.'\n\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0634 \u0645\u0646\u064a\u062d. h\u0101da mi\u0161 mn\u012b\u1e25.  / \u0647\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0648 \u0645\u0646\u064a\u062d. h\u0101d m\u016b mn\u012b\u1e25., 'That's not good.'\n\nPronouns\nLevantine has eight persons and eight pronouns. Contrary to MSA, dual pronouns do not exist in Levantine; the plural is used instead. Because conjugated verbs indicate the subject with a prefix or a suffix, independent subject pronouns are usually unnecessary and mainly used for emphasis. Feminine plural forms modifying human females are found primarily in rural and Bedouin areas. They are not mentioned below.\n\nDirect object pronouns are indicated by suffixes attached to the conjugated verb. Their form depends on whether the verb ends with a consonant or a vowel. Suffixed to nouns, these pronouns express possessive. Levantine does not have the verb \"to have\". Instead, possession is expressed using the prepositions \u200f\u0639\u0646\u062f\u200e \u0295ind, lit.\u2009'at' (meaning \"to possess\") and \u200f\u0645\u0639\u200e ma\u0295, lit.\u2009'with' (meaning \"to have on oneself\"), followed by personal pronoun suffixes.\n\nIndirect object pronouns (dative) are suffixed to the conjugated verb. They are formed by adding an \u0644 (-l) and then the possessive suffix to the verb. They precede object pronouns if present:\n\n\u062c\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0628\u0648\u064a j\u0101b il-jar\u012bde la-\u0294ab\u016by , 'he brought the newspaper to my father',\n\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u0628\u0648\u064a j\u0101b-ha la-\u0294ab\u016by , 'he brought it to my father',\n\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 jab-lo il-jar\u012bde , 'he brought him the newspaper',\n\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0627\u0647\u0627 jab-lo yy\u0101-ha , 'he brought it to him'.\n\nDemonstrative pronouns have three referential types: immediate, proximal, and distal. The distinction between proximal and distal demonstratives is of physical, temporal, or metaphorical distance. The genderless and numberless immediate demonstrative article \u200f\u0647\u0627\u200e ha is translated by \"this/the\", to designate something immediately visible or accessible.\n\nVerbs and verb phrases\nRoot and verb forms\nMost Levantine verbs are based on a triliteral root (also called radical or Semitic root) made of three consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb, e.g. \u200f\u0643 \u062a \u0628\u200e k-t-b ('write'), \u200f\u0642 \u0631 \u0621\u200e q-r-\u02bc ('read'), \u200f\u0621 \u0643 \u0644\u200e \u02bc-k-l ('eat'). Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person, and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as mood (e.g., indicative, subjunctive, imperative), voice (active or passive), and functions such as causative, intensive, or reflexive. Quadriliteral roots are less common but often used to coin new vocabulary or Arabicize foreign words. The base form is the third-person masculine singular of the perfect (also called past) tense.\nAlmost all Levantine verbs belong to one of ten verb forms (also called verb measures, stems, patterns, or types). Form I, the most common one, serves as a base for the other nine forms. Each form carries a different verbal idea relative to the meaning of its root. Technically, ten verbs can be constructed from any given triconsonantal root, although not all of these forms are used. After Form I, Forms II, V, VII, and X are the most common. Some irregular verbs do not fit into any of the verb forms.\nIn addition to its form, each verb has a \"quality\":\n\nSound (or regular): 3 distinct radicals, neither the second nor the third is 'w' or 'y',\nVerbs containing the radicals 'w' or 'y' are called weak. They are either:\nHollow: verbs with 'w' or 'y' as the second radical, which becomes a long 'a' in some forms, or\nDefective: verbs with 'w' or 'y' as the third radical, treated as a vowel,\nGeminate (or doubled): the second and third radicals are identical, remaining together as a double consonant.\n\nRegular verb conjugation\nThe Levantine verb has only two tenses: past (perfect) and present (also called imperfect, b-imperfect, or bi-imperfect). The present tense is formed by adding the prefix b- or m- to the verb root. The future tense is an extension of the present tense. The negative imperative is the same as the negative present with helping verb (imperfect). Various prefixes and suffixes designate the grammatical person and number as well as the mood. The following table shows the paradigm of a sound Form I verb, \u200f\u0643\u062a\u0628\u200e katab, 'to write'. There is no copula in the present tense in Levantine. In other tenses, the verb \u200f\u0643\u0627\u0646\u200e k\u0101n is used. Its present tense form is used in the future tense.\nThe b-imperfect is usually used for the indicative mood (non-past present, habitual/general present, narrative present, planned future actions, or potential). The prefix b- is deleted in the subjunctive mood, usually after modal verbs, auxiliary verbs, pseudo-verbs, prepositions, and particles. The future can also be expressed by the imperfect preceded by the particle \u200f\u0631\u062d\u200e ra\u1e25 or by the prefixed particle \u200f\u062d\u0640\u200e \u1e25a-. The present continuous is formed with the progressive particle \u200f\u0639\u0645\u200e \u0295am followed by the imperfect, with or without the initial b/m depending on the speaker.\nThe active participle, also called present participle, is grammatically an adjective derived from a verb. Depending on the context, it can express the present or present continuous (with verbs of motion, location, or mental state), the near future, or the present perfect (past action with a present result). It can also serve as a noun or an adjective. The passive participle, also called past participle, has a similar meaning as in English (i.e., sent, written). It is mainly used as an adjective and sometimes as a noun. It is inflected from the verb based on its verb form. However, passive participles are largely limited to verb forms I (CvCvC) and II (CvCCvC), becoming maCC\u016bC for the former and mCaCCaC for the latter.\n\nCompound tenses\nThe verb \u200f\u0643\u0627\u0646\u200e k\u0101n, followed by another verb, forms compound tenses. Both verbs are conjugated with their subject.\n\nPassive voice\nForm I verbs often correspond to an equivalent passive form VII verb, with the prefix n-. Form II and form III verbs usually correspond to an equivalent passive in forms V and VI, respectively, with the prefix t-. While the verb forms V, VI and VII are common in the simple past and compound tenses, the passive participle (past participle) is preferred in the present tense.\n\nNegation\nVerbs and prepositional phrases are negated by the particle \u200f\u0645\u0627\u200e m\u0101 / ma either on its own or, in the south, together with the suffix \u200f\u0640\u0634\u200e -i\u0161 at the end of the verb or prepositional phrase. In Palestinian, it is also common to negate verbs by the suffix \u200f\u0640\u0634\u200e -i\u0161 only.\n\nVocabulary\nThe lexicon of Levantine is overwhelmingly Arabic, and a large number of Levantine words are shared with at least another vernacular Arabic variety outside the Levant, especially with Egyptian. Many words, such as verbal nouns (also called gerunds or masdar), are derived from a Semitic root. For instance, \u200f\u062f\u0631\u0633\u200e dars, 'a lesson' is derived from \u200f\u200f\u062f\u0631\u0633\u200e daras, 'to study, to learn'. Levantine also includes layers of ancient languages: Aramaic (mainly Western Aramaic), Canaanite, classical Hebrew (Biblical and Mishnaic), Persian, Greek, and Latin.\nAramaic influence is significant, especially in vocabulary and in rural areas. Aramaic words underwent morphophonemic adaptation when they entered Levantine. Over time, it has become difficult to identify them. They belong to different fields of everyday life such as seasonal agriculture, housekeeping, tools and utensils, and Christian religious terms. Aramaic is still spoken in the Syrian villages of Maaloula, al-Sarkha, and Jubb'adin; near them, Aramaic borrowings are more frequent.\nSince the early modern period, Levantine has borrowed from Turkish and European languages, mainly English (particularly in technology and entertainment), French (especially in Lebanese due to the French Mandate), German, and Italian. Modern Hebrew significantly influences the Palestinian dialect spoken by Arab Israelis. Loanwords are gradually replaced with words of Arabic root. For instance, borrowings from Ottoman Turkish that were common in the 20th century have been largely replaced by Arabic words after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Arabic-speaking minorities in Turkey (mainly in Hatay) are still influenced by Turkish.\nWith about 50% of common words, Levantine (especially Palestinian) is the closest colloquial variety to MSA in terms of lexical similarity. In the vocabulary of five-year-old native Palestinians: 40% of the words are not present in MSA, 40% are related to MSA but phonologically different (sound change, addition, or deletion), and 20% are identical to MSA. In terms of morphemes, 20% are identical between MSA and Palestinian Arabic, 30% are strongly overlapping (slightly different forms, same function), 20% are partially overlapping (different forms, same function), and 30% are unique to Palestinian Arabic.\n\nSample text\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nBarth\u00e9lemy, Adrien (1935).

Here is a detailed extraction of the most useful information from the Wikipedia article:\n\n### Grammar\n\n#### Word Order\n- **VSO and SVO**: Both Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) and Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) orders are possible. SVO is more common in Levantine, while Classical Arabic prefers VSO.\n\n#### Nouns and Noun Phrases\n- **Gender and Number**: Nouns are either masculine or feminine and can be singular, dual, or plural. The dual is formed with the suffix \u064a\u0646- (-\u0113n).\n- **Definite Article**: The definite article \u0627\u0644 (il) precedes the noun or adjective and has multiple pronunciations. It assimilates with \"sun letters.\"\n- **Plural Formation**: Regular masculine plural is formed with -\u012bn, and feminine with -\u0101t. Broken plurals exist and are unpredictable.\n- **Genitive Construction**: Formed by juxtaposing nouns in a construct called i\u1e0d\u0101fah. The first noun is indefinite.\n- **Adjectives**: Typically have masculine singular, feminine singular, and plural forms. Adjectives follow the noun they modify and agree in definiteness.\n\n#### Pronouns\n- **Subject Pronouns**: Eight pronouns exist, with no dual forms. Independent subject pronouns are used for emphasis.\n- **Object Pronouns**: Indicated by suffixes attached to verbs for direct objects and possessive forms.\n- **Indirect Object Pronouns**: Formed by adding \u0644 (-l) and the possessive suffix to the verb.\n\n#### Verbs and Verb Phrases\n- **Root and Verb Forms**: Most verbs are based on a triliteral root. There are ten verb forms, with Form I being the most common.\n- **Regular Verb Conjugation**: Two tenses exist: past (perfect) and present (imperfect). The present tense is formed with the prefix b- or m-.\n- **Compound Tenses**: Formed with the verb \u0643\u0627\u0646 (k\u0101n) followed by another verb.\n- **Passive Voice**: Form I verbs often have a passive Form VII equivalent.\n- **Negation**: Verbs are negated by the particle \u0645\u0627 (m\u0101) or with the suffix \u0640\u0634 (-i\u0161).\n\n### Phonology\n\n- **Consonants**: Variations exist, such as the pronunciation of /q/ as [\u0294], [\u0261], or [k].\n- **Vowels**: Vowel length is phonemic. Diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/ are present in some dialects.\n- **Syllabification**: Complex, with helping vowels inserted to break consonant clusters.\n\n### Orthography and Writing Systems\n\n- **Scripts**: Levantine is written using Arabic, Latin (Arabizi), and Hebrew scripts. Arabizi is a non-standard romanization used online.\n- **Arabic Script**: Short vowels are usually not represented unless necessary for disambiguation.\n\n### Vocabulary\n\n- **Lexicon**: Overwhelmingly Arabic, with significant Aramaic influence. Borrowings from Turkish, English, French, and Modern Hebrew are present.\n- **Similarity to MSA**: Palestinian dialect is lexically closest to MSA, with about 50% common words.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- **Dictionaries and Corpora**: Resources like \"Currasat: Arabic Dialects Corpora\" and \"The Open Palestinian Arabic Lexicon 'Maknuune'\" are valuable for translators.\n\nThis comprehensive understanding of Levantine Arabic's linguistic features will aid translators in accurately converting text into this language.", "updated": "2025-03-04T16:59:08.344414"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language": {"base_content": "Chinese (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u8bed; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u8a9e; pinyin: H\u00e0ny\u01d4; lit. 'Han language' or \u4e2d\u6587; Zh\u014dngw\u00e9n; 'Chinese writing') is a group of languages spoken natively by the ethnic Han Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China, as well as by various communities of the Chinese diaspora. Approximately 1.35 billion people, or 17% of the global population, speak a variety of Chinese as their first language.\n\nChinese languages form the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The spoken varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be dialects of a single language. However, their lack of mutual intelligibility means they are sometimes considered to be separate languages in a family. Investigation of the historical relationships among the varieties of Chinese is ongoing. Currently, most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups based on phonetic developments from Middle Chinese, of which the most spoken by far is Mandarin with 66%, or around 800 million speakers, followed by Min (75 million, e.g. Southern Min), Wu (74 million, e.g. Shanghainese), and Yue (68 million, e.g. Cantonese). These branches are unintelligible to each other, and many of their subgroups are unintelligible with the other varieties within the same branch (e.g. Southern Min). There are, however, transitional areas where varieties from different branches share enough features for some limited intelligibility, including New Xiang with Southwestern Mandarin, Xuanzhou Wu Chinese with Lower Yangtze Mandarin, Jin with Central Plains Mandarin and certain divergent dialects of Hakka with Gan. All varieties of Chinese are tonal at least to some degree, and are largely analytic.\nThe earliest attested written Chinese consists of the oracle bone inscriptions created during the Shang dynasty c.\u20091250 BCE. The phonetic categories of Old Chinese can be reconstructed from the rhymes of ancient poetry. During the Northern and Southern period, Middle Chinese went through several sound changes and split into several varieties following prolonged geographic and political separation. The Qieyun, a rhyme dictionary, recorded a compromise between the pronunciations of different regions. The royal courts of the Ming and early Qing dynasties operated using a koin\u00e9 language known as Guanhua, based on the Nanjing dialect of Mandarin.\nStandard Chinese is an official language of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan), one of the four official languages of Singapore, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Standard Chinese is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin and was first officially adopted in the 1930s. The language is written primarily using a logography of Chinese characters, largely shared by readers who may otherwise speak mutually unintelligible varieties. Since the 1950s, the use of simplified characters has been promoted by the government of the People's Republic of China, with Singapore officially adopting them in 1976. Traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and among Chinese-speaking communities overseas.\n\nClassification\nLinguists classify all varieties of Chinese as part of the Sino-Tibetan language family, together with Burmese, Tibetan and many other languages spoken in the Himalayas and the Southeast Asian Massif. Although the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as Indo-European or Austroasiatic. Difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact. In addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach and are often also sensitive border zones. Without a secure reconstruction of Proto-Sino-Tibetan, the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear. A top-level branching into Chinese and Tibeto-Burman languages is often assumed, but has not been convincingly demonstrated.\n\nHistory\nThe first written records appeared over 3,000 years ago during the Shang dynasty. As the language evolved over this period, the various local varieties became mutually unintelligible. In reaction, central governments have repeatedly sought to promulgate a unified standard.\n\nOld and Middle Chinese\nThe earliest examples of Old Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones dated to c.\u20091250 BCE, during the Late Shang. The next attested stage came from inscriptions on bronze artifacts dating to the Western Zhou period (1046\u2013771 BCE), the Classic of Poetry and portions of the Book of Documents and I Ching. Scholars have attempted to reconstruct the phonology of Old Chinese by comparing later varieties of Chinese with the rhyming practice of the Classic of Poetry and the phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters. Although many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differs from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids. Most recent reconstructions also describe an atonal language with consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into tone distinctions in Middle Chinese. Several derivational affixes have also been identified, but the language lacks inflection, and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and grammatical particles.\nMiddle Chinese was the language used during Northern and Southern dynasties and the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties (6th\u201310th centuries). It can be divided into an early period, reflected by the Qieyun rhyme dictionary (601), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by rhyme tables such as the Yunjing constructed by ancient Chinese philologists as a guide to the Qieyun system. These works define phonological categories but with little hint of what sounds they represent. Linguists have identified these sounds by comparing the categories with pronunciations in modern varieties of Chinese, borrowed Chinese words in Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean, and transcription evidence. The resulting system is very complex, with a large number of consonants and vowels, but they are probably not all distinguished in any single dialect. Most linguists now believe it represents a diasystem encompassing 6th-century northern and southern standards for reading the classics.\n\nClassical and vernacular written forms\nThe complex relationship between spoken and written Chinese is an example of diglossia: as spoken, Chinese varieties have evolved at different rates, while the written language used throughout China changed comparatively little, crystallizing into a prestige form known as Classical or Literary Chinese. Literature written distinctly in the Classical form began to emerge during the Spring and Autumn period. Its use in writing remained nearly universal until the late 19th century, culminating with the widespread adoption of written vernacular Chinese with the May Fourth Movement beginning in 1919.\n\nRise of northern dialects\nAfter the fall of the Northern Song dynasty and subsequent reign of the Jurchen Jin and Mongol Yuan dynasties in northern China, a common speech (now called Old Mandarin) developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital.\nThe 1324 Zhongyuan Yinyun was a dictionary that codified the rhyming conventions of new sanqu verse form in this language.\nTogether with the slightly later Menggu Ziyun, this dictionary describes a language with many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects.\nUntil the early 20th century, most Chinese people only spoke their local variety. Thus, as a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as \u5b98\u8bdd; \u5b98\u8a71; Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0; 'language of officials'. For most of this period, this language was a koin\u00e9 based on dialects spoken in the Nanjing area, though not identical to any single dialect. By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.\nIn the 1930s, a standard national language (\u56fd\u8bed; \u570b\u8a9e; Gu\u00f3y\u01d4), was adopted. After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic founded in 1949 retained this standard but renamed it \u666e\u901a\u8bdd; \u666e\u901a\u8a71; p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0; 'common speech'. The national language is now used in education, the media, and formal situations in both mainland China and Taiwan.\nIn Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the dominant spoken language due to cultural influence from Guangdong immigrants and colonial-era policies, and is used in education, media, formal speech, and everyday life\u2014though Mandarin is increasingly taught in schools due to the mainland's growing influence.\n\nInfluence\nHistorically, the Chinese language has spread to its neighbors through a variety of means. Northern Vietnam was incorporated into the Han dynasty (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE) in 111 BCE, marking the beginning of a period of Chinese control that ran almost continuously for a millennium. The Four Commanderies of Han were established in northern Korea in the 1st century BCE but disintegrated in the following centuries. Chinese Buddhism spread over East Asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE, and with it the study of scriptures and literature in Literary Chinese. Later, strong central governments modeled on Chinese institutions were established in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, with Literary Chinese serving as the language of administration and scholarship, a position it would retain until the late 19th century in Korea and (to a lesser extent) Japan, and the early 20th century in Vietnam. Scholars from different lands could communicate, albeit only in writing, using Literary Chinese.\nAlthough they used Chinese solely for written communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud using what are known as Sino-Xenic pronunciations. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also extensively imported into the Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese languages, and today comprise over half of their vocabularies. This massive influx led to changes in the phonological structure of the languages, contributing to the development of moraic structure in Japanese and the disruption of vowel harmony in Korean.\nBorrowed Chinese morphemes have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts, in a similar way to the use of Latin and Ancient Greek roots in European languages. Many new compounds, or new meanings for old phrases, were created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to name Western concepts and artifacts. These coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages. They have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form. Often different compounds for the same concept were in circulation for some time before a winner emerged, and sometimes the final choice differed between countries. The proportion of vocabulary of Chinese origin thus tends to be greater in technical, abstract, or formal language. For example, in Japan, Sino-Japanese words account for about 35% of the words in entertainment magazines, over half the words in newspapers, and 60% of the words in science magazines.\nVietnam, Korea, and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, initially based on Chinese characters, but later replaced with the hangul alphabet for Korean and supplemented with kana syllabaries for Japanese, while Vietnamese continued to be written with the complex ch\u1eef N\u00f4m script. However, these were limited to popular literature until the late 19th century. Today Japanese is written with a composite script using both Chinese characters called kanji, and kana. Korean is written exclusively with hangul in North Korea, although knowledge of the supplementary Chinese characters called hanja is still required, and hanja are increasingly rarely used in South Korea. As a result of its historical colonization by France, Vietnamese now uses the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet.\nEnglish words of Chinese origin include tea from Hokkien \u8336 (t\u00ea), dim sum from Cantonese \u9ede\u5fc3 (dim2 sam1), and kumquat from Cantonese \u91d1\u6a58 (gam1 gwat1).\n\nVarieties\nThe sinologist Jerry Norman has estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese. These varieties form a dialect continuum, in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, though the rate of change varies immensely. Generally, mountainous South China exhibits more linguistic diversity than the North China Plain. Until the late 20th century, Chinese emigrants to Southeast Asia and North America came from southeast coastal areas, where Min, Hakka, and Yue dialects were spoken. Specifically, most Chinese immigrants to North America until the mid-20th century spoke Taishanese, a variety of Yue from a small coastal area around Taishan, Guangdong.\nIn parts of South China, the dialect of a major city may be only marginally intelligible to its neighbors. For example, Wuzhou and Taishan are located approximately 260 km (160 mi) and 190 km (120 mi) away from Guangzhou respectively, but the Yue variety spoken in Wuzhou is more similar to the Guangzhou dialect than is Taishanese.  Wuzhou is located directly upstream from Guangzhou on the Pearl River, whereas Taishan is to Guangzhou's southwest, with the two cities separated by several river valleys. In parts of Fujian, the speech of some neighbouring counties or villages is mutually unintelligible.\n\nGrouping\nLocal varieties of Chinese are conventionally classified into seven dialect groups, largely based on the different evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials:\n\nMandarin, including Standard Chinese, the Beijing dialect, Sichuanese, and also the Dungan language spoken in Central Asia\nWu, including Shanghainese, Suzhounese, and Wenzhounese\nGan\nXiang\nMin, including Fuzhounese, Hainanese, Hokkien and Teochew\nHakka\nYue, including Cantonese and Taishanese\n\nThe classification of Li Rong, which is used in the Language Atlas of China (1987), distinguishes three further groups:\n\nJin, previously included in Mandarin.\nHuizhou, previously included in Wu.\nPinghua, previously included in Yue.\nSome varieties remain unclassified, including the Danzhou dialect on Hainan, Waxianghua spoken in western Hunan, and Shaozhou Tuhua spoken in northern Guangdong.\n\nStandard Chinese\nStandard Chinese is the standard language of China (where it is called \u666e\u901a\u8bdd; p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0) and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore (where it is called either \u534e\u8bed; \u83ef\u8a9e; Hu\u00e1y\u01d4 or \u6c49\u8bed; \u6f22\u8a9e; H\u00e0ny\u01d4). Standard Chinese is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. The governments of both China and Taiwan intend for speakers of all Chinese speech varieties to use it as a common language of communication. Therefore, it is used in government agencies, in the media, and as a language of instruction in schools.\nDiglossia is common among Chinese speakers. For example, a Shanghai resident may speak both Standard Chinese and Shanghainese; if they grew up elsewhere, they are also likely fluent in the dialect of their home region. In addition to Standard Chinese, a majority of Taiwanese people also speak Taiwanese Hokkien (also called \u53f0\u8a9e; 'Taiwanese'), Hakka, or an Austronesian language. A speaker in Taiwan may mix pronunciations and vocabulary from Standard Chinese and other languages of Taiwan in everyday speech. In part due to traditional cultural ties with Guangdong, Cantonese is used as an everyday language in Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nNomenclature\nThe designation of various Chinese branches remains controversial. Some linguists and most ordinary Chinese people consider all the spoken varieties as one single language, as speakers share a common national identity and a common written form. Others instead argue that it is inappropriate to refer to major branches of Chinese such as Mandarin, Wu, and so on as \"dialects\" because the mutual unintelligibility between them is too great. However, calling major Chinese branches \"languages\" would also be wrong under the same criterion, since a branch such as Wu, itself contains many mutually unintelligible varieties, and could not be properly called a single language.\nThere are also viewpoints pointing out that linguists often ignore mutual intelligibility when varieties share intelligibility with a central variety (i.e. prestige variety, such as Standard Mandarin), as the issue requires some careful handling when mutual intelligibility is inconsistent with language identity.\nThe Chinese government's official Chinese designation for the major branches of Chinese is \u65b9\u8a00; f\u0101ngy\u00e1n; 'regional speech', whereas the more closely related varieties within these are called \u5730\u70b9\u65b9\u8a00; \u5730\u9ede\u65b9\u8a00; d\u00ecdi\u01cen f\u0101ngy\u00e1n; 'local speech'.\nBecause of the difficulties involved in determining the difference between language and dialect, other terms have been proposed. These include topolect, lect, vernacular, regional, and variety.\n\nPhonology\nSyllables in the Chinese languages have some unique characteristics. They are tightly related to the morphology and also to the characters of the writing system, and phonologically they are structured according to fixed rules.\nThe structure of each syllable consists of a nucleus that has a vowel (which can be a monophthong, diphthong, or even a triphthong in certain varieties), preceded by an onset (a single consonant, or consonant + glide; a zero onset is also possible), and followed (optionally) by a coda consonant; a syllable also carries a tone. There are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus. An example of this is in Cantonese, where the nasal sonorant consonants /m/ and /\u014b/ can stand alone as their own syllable.\nIn Mandarin much more than in other spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda (assuming that a final glide is not analyzed as a coda), but syllables that do have codas are restricted to nasals /m/, /n/, /\u014b/, the retroflex approximant /\u027b/, and voiceless stops /p/, /t/, /k/, or /\u0294/. Some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as Standard Chinese, are limited to only /n/, /\u014b/, and /\u027b/.\nThe number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general, there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from Middle Chinese. The Mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more polysyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. The total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation, which is only about an eighth as many as English.\n\nTones\nAll varieties of spoken Chinese use tones to distinguish words. A few dialects of north China may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south China have up to 6 or 12 tones, depending on how one counts. One exception from this is Shanghainese which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned pitch accent system much like modern Japanese.\nA very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in Chinese is the application of the four tones of Standard Chinese, along with the neutral tone, to the syllable ma. The tones are exemplified by the following five Chinese words:\n\nIn contrast, Standard Cantonese has six tones. Historically, finals that end in a stop consonant were considered to be \"checked tones\" and thus counted separately for a total of nine tones. However, they are considered to be duplicates in modern linguistics and are no longer counted as such:\n\nGrammar\nChinese is often described as a 'monosyllabic' language. However, this is only partially correct. It is largely accurate when describing Old and Middle Chinese; in Classical Chinese, around 90% of words consist of a single character that corresponds one-to-one with a morpheme, the smallest unit of meaning in a language. In modern varieties, it usually remains the case that morphemes are monosyllabic\u2014in contrast, English has many multi-syllable morphemes, both bound and free, such as 'seven', 'elephant', 'para-' and '-able'. Some of the more conservative modern varieties, usually found in the south, have largely monosyllabic words, especially with basic vocabulary. However, most nouns, adjectives, and verbs in modern Mandarin are disyllabic. A significant cause of this is phonetic erosion: sound changes over time have steadily reduced the number of possible syllables in the language's inventory. In modern Mandarin, there are only around 1,200 possible syllables, including the tonal distinctions, compared with about 5,000 in Vietnamese (still a largely monosyllabic language), and over 8,000 in English.\nMost modern varieties tend to form new words through polysyllabic compounds. In some cases, monosyllabic words have become disyllabic formed from different characters without the use of compounding, as in \u7a9f\u7abf; k\u016blong from \u5b54; k\u01d2ng; this is especially common in Jin varieties. This phonological collapse has led to a corresponding increase in the number of homophones. As an example, the small Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary lists six words that are commonly pronounced as sh\u00ed in Standard Chinese:\n\nIn modern spoken Mandarin, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used as-is. The 20th century Yuen Ren Chao poem Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den exploits this, consisting of 92 characters all pronounced shi. As such, most of these words have been replaced in speech, if not in writing, with less ambiguous disyllabic compounds. Only the first one, \u5341, normally appears in monosyllabic form in spoken Mandarin; the rest are normally used in the polysyllabic forms of\n\nrespectively. In each, the homophone was disambiguated by the addition of another morpheme, typically either a near-synonym or some sort of generic word (e.g. 'head', 'thing'), the purpose of which is to indicate which of the possible meanings of the other, homophonic syllable is specifically meant.\nHowever, when one of the above words forms part of a compound, the disambiguating syllable is generally dropped and the resulting word is still disyllabic. For example, \u77f3; sh\u00ed alone, and not \u77f3\u5934; \u77f3\u982d; sh\u00edtou, appears in compounds as meaning 'stone' such as \u77f3\u818f; sh\u00edg\u0101o; 'plaster', \u77f3\u7070; sh\u00edhu\u012b; 'lime', \u77f3\u7a9f; sh\u00edk\u016b; 'grotto', \u77f3\u82f1; 'quartz', and \u77f3\u6cb9; sh\u00edy\u00f3u; 'petroleum'. Although many single-syllable morphemes (\u5b57; z\u00ec) can stand alone as individual words, they more often than not form multi-syllable compounds known as \u8bcd; \u8a5e; c\u00ed, which more closely resembles the traditional Western notion of a word. A Chinese c\u00ed can consist of more than one character\u2013morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.\nExamples of Chinese words of more than two syllables include \u6c49\u5821\u5305; \u6f22\u5821\u5305; h\u00e0nb\u01ceob\u0101o; 'hamburger', \u5b88\u95e8\u5458; \u5b88\u9580\u54e1; sh\u01d2um\u00e9nyu\u00e1n; 'goalkeeper', and \u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6; \u96fb\u5b50\u90f5\u4ef6; di\u00e0nz\u01d0y\u00f3uji\u00e0n; 'e-mail'.\nAll varieties of modern Chinese are analytic languages: they depend on syntax (word order and sentence structure), rather than inflectional morphology (changes in the form of a word), to indicate a word's function within a sentence. In other words, Chinese has very few grammatical inflections\u2014it possesses no tenses, no voices, no grammatical number, and only a few articles. They make heavy use of grammatical particles to indicate aspect and mood. In Mandarin, this involves the use of particles such as \u4e86; le; 'PFV', \u8fd8; \u9084; h\u00e1i; 'still', and \u5df2\u7ecf; \u5df2\u7d93; y\u01d0j\u012bng; 'already'.\nChinese has a subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order, and like many other languages of East Asia, makes frequent use of the topic\u2013comment construction to form sentences. Chinese also has an extensive system of classifiers and measure words, another trait shared with neighboring languages such as Japanese and Korean. Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of serial verb construction, pronoun dropping, and the related subject dropping. Although the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess differences.\n\nVocabulary\nThe entire Chinese character corpus since antiquity comprises well over 50,000 characters, of which only roughly 10,000 are in use and only about 3,000 are frequently used in Chinese media and newspapers. However, Chinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words. Because most Chinese words are made up of two or more characters, there are many more Chinese words than characters. A more accurate equivalent for a Chinese character is the morpheme, as characters represent the smallest grammatical units with individual meanings in the Chinese language.\nEstimates of the total number of Chinese words and lexicalized phrases vary greatly. The Hanyu Da Zidian, a compendium of Chinese characters, includes 54,678 head entries for characters, including oracle bone versions. The Zhonghua Zihai (1994) contains 85,568 head entries for character definitions and is the largest reference work based purely on character and its literary variants. The CC-CEDICT project (2010) contains 97,404 contemporary entries including idioms, technology terms, and names of political figures, businesses, and products. The 2009 version of the Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary (WDCD), based on CC-CEDICT, contains over 84,000 entries.\nThe most comprehensive pure linguistic Chinese-language dictionary, the 12-volume Hanyu Da Cidian, records more than 23,000 head Chinese characters and gives over 370,000 definitions. The 1999 revised Cihai, a multi-volume encyclopedic dictionary reference work, gives 122,836 vocabulary entry definitions under 19,485 Chinese characters, including proper names, phrases, and common zoological, geographical, sociological, scientific, and technical terms.\nThe 2016 edition of Xiandai Hanyu Cidian, an authoritative one-volume dictionary on modern standard Chinese language as used in mainland China, has 13,000 head characters and defines 70,000 words.\n\nLoanwords\nLike many other languages, Chinese has absorbed a sizable number of loanwords from other cultures. Most Chinese words are formed out of native Chinese morphemes, including words describing imported objects and ideas. However, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times.\nSome early Indo-European loanwords in Chinese have been proposed, notably 'honey' (\u871c; m\u00ec), 'lion' (\u72ee; \u7345; sh\u012b), and perhaps 'horse' (\u9a6c; \u99ac; m\u01ce), 'pig' (\u732a; \u8c6c; zh\u016b), 'dog' (\u72ac; qu\u01cen), and 'goose' (\u9e45; \u9d5d; \u00e9).\nAncient words borrowed from along the Silk Road during the Old Chinese period include 'grape' (\u8461\u8404; p\u00fat\u00e1o), 'pomegranate' (\u77f3\u69b4; sh\u00edli\u00fa), and 'lion' (\u72ee\u5b50; \u7345\u5b50; sh\u012bzi). Some words were borrowed from Buddhist scriptures, including 'Buddha' (\u4f5b; F\u00f3) and 'bodhisattva' (\u83e9\u8428; \u83e9\u85a9; P\u00fas\u00e0). Other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as 'hutong' (\u80e1\u540c). Words borrowed from the peoples along the Silk Road, such as 'grape' (\u8461\u8404), generally have Persian etymologies. Buddhist terminology is generally derived from Sanskrit or Pali, the liturgical languages of northern India. Words borrowed from the nomadic tribes of the Gobi, Mongolian or northeast regions generally have Altaic etymologies, such as \u7435\u7436 (p\u00edp\u00e1), the Chinese lute, or 'cheese or yogurt' (\u916a; l\u00e0o), but from exactly which source is not always clear.\n\nModern borrowings\nModern neologisms are primarily translated into Chinese in one of three ways: free translation (calques), phonetic translation (by sound), or a combination of the two. Today, it is much more common to use existing Chinese morphemes to coin new words to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions and international scientific vocabulary, wherein the Latin and Greek components are usually converted one-for-one into the corresponding Chinese characters. The word 'telephone' was initially loaned phonetically as \u5fb7\u5f8b\u98ce; \u5fb7\u5f8b\u98a8 (d\u00e9l\u01dcf\u0113ng; Shanghainese t\u00e9l\u00edfon [t\u0259l\u026afo\u014b])\u2014this word was widely used in Shanghai during the 1920s, but the later \u7535\u8bdd; \u96fb\u8a71 (di\u00e0nhu\u00e0; 'electric speech'), built out of native Chinese morphemes became prevalent. Other examples include\n\nOccasionally, compromises between the transliteration and translation approaches become accepted, such as \u6c49\u5821\u5305; \u6f22\u5821\u5305 (h\u00e0nb\u01ceob\u0101o; 'hamburger') from \u6c49\u5821; 'Hamburg' + \u5305 ('bun'). Sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating Chinese morphemes (phono-semantic matching), such as \u9a6c\u5229\u5965; \u99ac\u5229\u5967 (M\u01cel\u00ec'\u00e0o) for the video game character 'Mario'. This is often done for commercial purposes, for example \u5954\u817e; \u5954\u9a30 (b\u0113nt\u00e9ng; 'dashing-leaping') for 'Pentium' and \u8d5b\u767e\u5473; \u8cfd\u767e\u5473 (S\u00e0ib\u01ceiw\u00e8i; 'better-than hundred tastes') for 'Subway'.\nForeign words, mainly proper nouns, continue to enter the Chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. This is done by employing Chinese characters with similar pronunciations. For example, 'Israel' becomes \u4ee5\u8272\u5217 (Y\u01d0s\u00e8li\u00e8), and 'Paris' becomes \u5df4\u9ece (B\u0101l\u00ed). A rather small number of direct transliterations have survived as common words, including \u6c99\u53d1; \u6c99\u767c (sh\u0101f\u0101; 'sofa'), \u9a6c\u8fbe; \u99ac\u9054 (m\u01ced\u00e1; 'motor'), \u5e7d\u9ed8 (y\u014dum\u00f2; 'humor'), \u903b\u8f91; \u908f\u8f2f (lu\u00f3ji, lu\u00f3j\u00ed; 'logic'), \u65f6\u9ae6; \u6642\u9ae6 (sh\u00edm\u00e1o; 'smart (fashionable)'), and \u6b47\u65af\u5e95\u91cc (xi\u0113s\u012bd\u01d0l\u01d0; 'hysterics'). The bulk of these words were originally coined in Shanghai during the early 20th century and later loaned from there into Mandarin, hence their Mandarin pronunciations occasionally being quite divergent from the English. For example, in Shanghainese \u6c99\u53d1; \u6c99\u767c (sofa) and \u9a6c\u8fbe; \u99ac\u9054 ('motor') sound more like their English counterparts. Cantonese differs from Mandarin with some transliterations, such as \u68b3\u5316 (so1 faa3,2; 'sofa') and \u6469\u6253 (mo1 daa2; 'motor').\nWestern foreign words representing Western concepts have influenced Chinese since the 20th century through transcription. From French, \u82ad\u857e (b\u0101l\u011bi) and \u9999\u69df; \u9999\u6ab3 (xi\u0101ngb\u012bn) were borrowed for 'ballet' and 'champagne' respectively; \u5496\u5561 (k\u0101f\u0113i) was borrowed from Italian caff\u00e8 'coffee'. The influence of English is particularly pronounced: from the early 20th century, many English words were borrowed into Shanghainese, such as \u9ad8\u5c14\u592b; \u9ad8\u723e\u592b (g\u0101o'\u011brf\u016b; 'golf') and the aforementioned \u6c99\u53d1; \u6c99\u767c (sh\u0101f\u0101; 'sofa'). Later, American soft power gave rise to \u8fea\u65af\u79d1 (d\u00eds\u012bk\u0113; 'disco'), \u53ef\u4e50; \u53ef\u6a02 (k\u011bl\u00e8; 'cola'), and \u8ff7\u4f60\u88d9; m\u00edn\u01d0q\u00fan ('miniskirt'). Contemporary colloquial Cantonese has distinct loanwords from English, such as \u5361\u901a (kaa1 tung1; 'cartoon'), \u57fa\u4f6c (gei1 lou2; 'gay people'), \u7684\u58eb (dik1 si6,2; 'taxi'), and \u5df4\u58eb (baa1 si6,2; 'bus'). With the rising popularity of the Internet, there is a current vogue in China for coining English transliterations, for example, \u7c89\u4e1d; \u7c89\u7d72 (f\u011bns\u012b; 'fans'), \u9ed1\u5ba2 (h\u0113ik\u00e8; 'hacker'), and \u535a\u5ba2 (b\u00f3k\u00e8; 'blog'). In Taiwan, some of these transliterations are different, such as \u99ed\u5ba2 (h\u00e0ik\u00e8; 'hacker') and \u90e8\u843d\u683c (b\u00f9lu\u00f2g\u00e9; 'interconnected tribes') for 'blog'.\nAnother result of English influence on Chinese is the appearance of so-called \u5b57\u6bcd\u8bcd; \u5b57\u6bcd\u8a5e (z\u00ecm\u01d4c\u00ed; 'lettered words') spelled with letters from the English alphabet. These have appeared in colloquial usage, as well as in magazines and newspapers, and on websites and television:\n\nSince the 20th century, another source of words has been kanji: Japan re-molded European concepts and inventions into \u548c\u88fd\u6f22\u8a9e, wasei-kango, 'Japanese-made Chinese', and many of these words have been re-loaned into modern Chinese. Other terms were coined by the Japanese by giving new senses to existing Chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical Chinese literature. For example, \u7ecf\u6d4e; \u7d93\u6fdf; j\u012bngj\u00ec; \u7d4c\u6e08, keizai in Japanese, which in the original Chinese meant 'the workings of the state', narrowed to 'economy' in Japanese; this narrowed definition was then re-imported into Chinese. As a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words: indeed, there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first. As a result of this loaning, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese share a corpus of linguistic terms describing modern terminology, paralleling the similar corpus of terms built from Greco-Latin and shared among European languages.\n\nWriting system\nThe Chinese orthography centers on Chinese characters, which are written within imaginary square blocks, traditionally arranged in vertical columns, read from top to bottom down a column, and right to left across columns, despite alternative arrangement with rows of characters from left to right within a row and from top to bottom across rows (like English and other Western writing systems) having become more popular since the 20th century. Chinese characters denote morphemes independent of phonetic variation in different languages. Thus the character \u4e00 ('one') is pronounced as y\u012b in Standard Chinese, yat1 in Cantonese and it in Hokkien, a form of Min.\nMost modern written Chinese is in the form of written vernacular Chinese, based on spoken Standard Chinese, regardless of dialectical background. Written vernacular Chinese largely replaced Literary Chinese in the early 20th century as the country's standard written language. However, vocabularies from different Chinese-speaking areas have diverged, and the divergence can be observed in written Chinese.\nDue to the divergence of variants, some unique morphemes are not found in Standard Chinese. Characters rarely used in Standard Chinese have also been created or inherited from archaic literary standards to represent these unique morphemes. For example, characters like \u5187 and \u4fc2 are actively used in Cantonese and Hakka, while being archaic or unused in standard written Chinese. The most prominent example of a non-Standard Chinese orthography is Written Cantonese, which is used in tabloids and on the internet among Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong and elsewhere.\nChinese had no uniform system of phonetic transcription until the mid-20th century, although enunciation patterns were recorded in early rhyme dictionaries and dictionaries. Early Indian translators, working in Sanskrit and Pali, were the first to attempt to describe the sounds and enunciation patterns of Chinese in a foreign language. After the 15th century, the efforts of Jesuits and Western court missionaries resulted in some Latin character transcription/writing systems, based on various variants of Chinese languages. Some of these Latin character-based systems are still being used to write various Chinese variants in the modern era.\nIn Hunan, women in certain areas write their local Chinese language variant in N\u00fcshu, a syllabary derived from Chinese characters. The Dungan language, considered by many a dialect of Mandarin, is nowadays written in Cyrillic and was previously written in the Arabic script. The Dungan people are primarily Muslim and live mainly in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia; many Hui people, living mainly in China, also speak the language.\n\nChinese characters\nEach Chinese character represents a monosyllabic Chinese word or morpheme. In 100 CE, the famed Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen classified characters into six categories: pictographs, simple ideographs, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds, and derivative characters. Only 4% were categorized as pictographs, including many of the simplest characters, such as \u4eba (r\u00e9n; 'human'), \u65e5 (r\u00ec; 'Sun'), \u5c71 (sh\u0101n; 'mountain'), and \u6c34 (shu\u01d0; 'water'). Between 80% and 90% were classified as phonetic compounds such as \u6c96 (ch\u014dng; 'pour'), combining a phonetic component \u4e2d (zh\u014dng) with a semantic component of the radical \u6c35, a reduced form of \u6c34; 'water'. Almost all characters created since have been made using this format. The 18th-century Kangxi Dictionary classified characters under a now-common set of 214 radicals.\nModern characters are styled after the regular script. Various other written styles are also used in Chinese calligraphy, including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. Calligraphy artists can write in Traditional and Simplified characters, but they tend to use Traditional characters for traditional art.\nThere are currently two systems for Chinese characters. Traditional characters, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, and many overseas Chinese-speaking communities, largely take their form from received character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty and standardized during the Ming. Simplified characters, introduced by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, especially by adopting common cursive shorthand variants and merging characters with similar pronunciations to the one with the least strokes, among other methods. Singapore, which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters\u2014first by creating its own simplified characters, then by adopting entirely the PRC simplified characters. It has also become the de facto standard for younger ethnic Chinese in Malaysia.\nThe Internet provides practice reading each of these systems, and most Chinese readers are capable of, if not necessarily comfortable with, reading the alternative system through experience and guesswork.\nA well-educated Chinese reader today recognizes approximately 4,000 to 6,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a mainland newspaper. The PRC defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. School children typically learn around 2,000 characters whereas scholars may memorize up to 10,000. A large unabridged dictionary like the Kangxi dictionary, contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.\n\nRomanization\nRomanization is the process of transcribing a language into the Latin script. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese varieties, due to the lack of a native phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western Christian missionaries in the 16th century.\nToday the most common romanization for Standard Chinese is Hanyu Pinyin, introduced in 1956 by the PRC, and later adopted by Singapore and Taiwan. Pinyin is almost universally employed now for teaching standard spoken Chinese in schools and universities across the Americas, Australia, and Europe. Chinese parents also use Pinyin to teach their children the sounds and tones of new words. In school books that teach Chinese, the pinyin romanization is often shown below a picture of the thing the word represents, with the Chinese character alongside.\nThe second-most common romanization system, the Wade\u2013Giles, was invented by Thomas Wade in 1859 and modified by Herbert Giles in 1892. As this system approximates the phonology of Mandarin Chinese into English consonants and vowels\u2013it is largely an anglicization, it may be particularly helpful for beginner Chinese speakers of an English-speaking background. Wade\u2013Giles was found in academic use in the United States, particularly before the 1980s, and was widely used in Taiwan until 2009.\nWhen used within European texts, the tone transcriptions in both pinyin and Wade\u2013Giles are often left out for simplicity; Wade\u2013Giles's extensive use of apostrophes is also usually omitted. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with Beijing than they will be with B\u011bij\u012bng (pinyin), and with Taipei than T'ai2-pei3 (Wade\u2013Giles). This simplification presents syllables as homophones which are not, and therefore exaggerates the number of homophones almost by a factor of four.\nFor comparison:\n\nOther systems include Gwoyeu Romatzyh, the French EFEO, the Yale system (invented for use by US troops during World War II), as well as distinct systems for the phonetic requirements of Cantonese, Min Nan, Hakka, and other varieties.\n\nOther phonetic transcriptions\nChinese varieties have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. The 'Phags-pa script, for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciations of premodern forms of Chinese. Bopomofo (or zhuyin) is a semi-syllabary that is still widely used in Taiwan to aid standard pronunciation. There are also at least two systems of cyrillization for Chinese. The most widespread is the Palladius system.\n\nAs a foreign language\nWith the growing importance and influence of China's economy globally, Standard Chinese instruction has been gaining popularity in schools throughout East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western world.\nBesides Mandarin, Cantonese is the only other Chinese language that is widely taught as a foreign language, largely due to the economic and cultural influence of Hong Kong and its widespread usage among significant Overseas Chinese communities.\nIn 1991, there were 2,000 foreign learners taking China's official Chinese Proficiency Test, called Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK), comparable to the English Cambridge Certificate, but by 2005 the number of candidates had risen sharply to 117,660 and in 2010 to 750,000.\n\nSee also\nChengyu\nChinese computational linguistics\nChinese exclamative particles\nChinese honorifics\nChinese language law\nChinese numerals\nChinese punctuation\nChinese word-segmented writing\nClassical Chinese grammar\nHan unification\nLanguages of China\nNorth American Conference on Chinese Linguistics\nProtection of the varieties of Chinese\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nFurther reading\nArablouei, Ramtin; et al.

Here is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article on the Chinese language:\n\n1. **Language Classification and Varieties**:\n   - Chinese is part of the Sino-Tibetan language family and includes several mutually unintelligible varieties often referred to as dialects. The main groups are Mandarin, Wu, Gan, Xiang, Min, Hakka, and Yue.\n   - Mandarin is the most widely spoken, with Standard Chinese (based on the Beijing dialect) being the official language in China and Taiwan.\n\n2. **Phonology**:\n   - Chinese syllables consist of an onset, a nucleus, and an optional coda, with each syllable carrying a tone.\n   - Mandarin has four tones plus a neutral tone, while Cantonese has six tones.\n   - The structure of syllables and the use of tones are crucial for distinguishing meanings.\n\n3. **Grammar**:\n   - Chinese is an analytic language, relying on word order and particles rather than inflectional morphology.\n   - It follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.\n   - There are no tenses, voices, or grammatical numbers, but aspect and mood are indicated using particles like \u4e86 (le), \u8fd8 (h\u00e1i), and \u5df2\u7ecf (y\u01d0j\u012bng).\n   - The language uses classifiers and measure words extensively.\n\n4. **Vocabulary**:\n   - Chinese words are often polysyllabic, formed through compounding.\n   - Homophones are common due to the limited number of syllables, leading to the use of disyllabic compounds for clarity.\n   - The language has absorbed many loanwords, often adapted through phonetic or semantic translation.\n\n5. **Writing System**:\n   - Chinese characters are logographic, each representing a morpheme.\n   - There are two character systems: Traditional (used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau) and Simplified (used in mainland China and Singapore).\n   - Characters are categorized into pictographs, ideographs, and phonetic compounds.\n\n6. **Romanization**:\n   - Pinyin is the most common system for transcribing Chinese into the Latin alphabet, essential for learning pronunciation.\n   - Wade-Giles is another system, historically used in Taiwan and academic contexts.\n\n7. **Tones**:\n   - Understanding and correctly applying tones is critical, as they differentiate meanings of words that otherwise have the same phonetic form.\n\n8. **Loanwords and Neologisms**:\n   - Modern Chinese incorporates foreign words through phonetic transcription and semantic translation, often creating new compounds using existing morphemes.\n\n9. **Historical Context**:\n   - The evolution of Chinese from Old and Middle Chinese to modern varieties has influenced its phonology and grammar.\n   - Classical Chinese was the written standard until the 20th century, replaced by written vernacular Chinese.\n\n10. **Additional Resources**:\n    - For further study, resources like the Hanyu Da Cidian and Xiandai Hanyu Cidian provide comprehensive dictionaries of Chinese characters and words.\n\nThis information provides a foundational understanding necessary for translating text into Chinese, highlighting the importance of phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and the writing system.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:00:05.768279"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi": {"base_content": "Modern Standard Hindi (\u0906\u0927\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0915 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940, \u0100dhunik M\u0101nak Hind\u012b), commonly referred to as Hindi, is the standardised variety of the Hindustani language written in the Devanagari script. It is an official language of the Government of India, alongside English, and it is also the lingua franca of North India. Hindi is considered a Sanskritised register of Hindustani, which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and neighbouring areas.\nHindi is an official language in nine states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand), and three union territories (Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Chandigarh), and an additional official language in three other states - West Bengal, Nagaland, Mizoram. Hindi is also one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.\nApart from the script and formal vocabulary, standard Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu, which is another recognised register of Hindustani, as both Hindi and Urdu share a core vocabulary base derived from Shauraseni Prakrit (a descendant of Vedic Sanskrit). Hindi is also spoken, to a lesser extent, in other parts of India (usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi). Outside India, several other languages are recognised officially as \"Hindi\" but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other nearby languages, such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri. Such languages include Fiji Hindi, which has an official status in Fiji, and Caribbean Hindustani, which is spoken in Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.\nHindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish, and English. When counted together with the mutually intelligible Urdu, it is the third most-spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English. According to reports of Ethnologue (2022, 25th edition), Hindi is the third most-spoken language in the world when including first and second language speakers.\nHindi is the fastest-growing language of India, followed by Kashmiri, Meitei, Gujarati and Bengali, according to the 2011 census of India.\n\nTerminology\nThe term Hind\u012b was originally used to refer to inhabitants of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It was borrowed from Classical Persian  \u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc Hind\u012b (Iranian Persian pronunciation: Hendi), meaning 'of or belonging to Hind (India)' (hence, 'Indian').\nAnother name Hindav\u012b (\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0935\u0940) or Hindu\u012b (\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0908) (from Persian  \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0648\u06cc 'of or belonging to the Hindu/Indian people') was often used in the past, for example, by Amir Khusrau in his poetry.\nThe terms Hindi and Hindu trace back to Old Persian, which derived these names from the Sanskrit name Sindhu (\u0938\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0941), referring to the Indus River. The Greek cognates of the same terms are Indus (for the river) and India (for the land of the river).\nThe term Modern Standard Hindi is commonly used to specifically refer to the modern literary Hindi language, as opposed to colloquial and regional varieties that are also referred to as Hindi in a wider sense.\n\nHistory\nMiddle Indo-Aryan to Hindi\nLike other Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi is a direct descendant of an early form of Vedic Sanskrit, through Shauraseni Prakrit and \u015aauraseni Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba (from Sanskrit apabhra\u1e43\u015ba \"corrupt\"), which emerged in the 7th century CE.\nThe sound changes that characterised the transition from Middle Indo-Aryan to Hindi are:\n\nCompensatory lengthening of vowels preceding geminate consonants, sometimes with spontaneous nasalisation: Skt. hasta \"hand\" > Pkt. hattha > h\u0101th\nLoss of all word-final vowels: r\u0101tri \"night\" > ratt\u012b > r\u0101t\nFormation of nasalised long vowels from nasal consonants (-VNC- > -V\u0304\u0303C-): bandha \"bond\" > b\u0101\u0303dh\nLoss of unaccented or unstressed short vowels (reflected in schwa deletion): susthira \"firm\" > sutthira > suthr\u0101\nCollapsing of adjacent vowels (including separated by a hiatus: apara \"other\" > avara > aur\nFinal -m to -\u1e7d: gr\u0101ma \"village\" > g\u0101ma > g\u0101\u1e7d\nIntervocalic -\u1e0d- to -\u1e5b- or -l-: ta\u1e0d\u0101ga \"pond\" > tal\u0101v, na\u1e0da \"reed\" > nal.\nv > b: viv\u0101ha \"marriage\" > by\u0101h\n\nHindustani\nDuring the period of Delhi Sultanate in medieval India, which covered most of today's north India, eastern Pakistan, southern Nepal and Bangladesh and which resulted in the contact of Hindu and Muslim cultures, the Sanskrit and Prakrit base of Old Hindi became enriched with loanwords from Persian, evolving into the present form of Hindustani. Hindi achieved prominence in India after it became the official language of the imperial court during the reign of Shah Jahan. It is recorded that Emperor Aurangzeb spoke in Hindvi. The Hindustani vernacular became an expression of Indian national unity during the Indian Independence movement, and continues to be spoken as the common language of the people of the northern Indian subcontinent, which is reflected in the Hindustani vocabulary of Bollywood films and songs.\nStandard Hindi is based on the language that was spoken in the Ganges-Yamuna Doab (Delhi, Meerut and Saharanpur) called Khariboli; the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region came to replace earlier prestige languages such as Awadhi and Braj. Standard Hindi was developed by supplanting foreign loanwords from the Hindustani language and replacing them with Sanskrit words, though Standard Hindi does continue to possess several Persian loanwords. Modern Hindi became a literary language in the 19th century. Earliest examples could be found as Pr\u0113m S\u0101gar by Lallu Lal, Batiy\u0101l Pach\u012bs\u012b of Sadal Misra, and R\u0101n\u012b K\u0113tak\u012b K\u012b Kah\u0101n\u012b of Insha Allah Khan which were published in Devanagari script during the early 19th century.\nJohn Gilchrist was principally known for his study of the Hindustani language, which was adopted as the lingua franca of northern India (including what is now present-day Pakistan) by British colonists and indigenous people. He compiled and authored An English-Hindustani Dictionary, A Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language, The Oriental Linguist, and many more. His lexicon of Hindustani was published in the Perso-Arabic script, N\u0101gar\u012b script, and in Roman transliteration. In the late 19th century, a movement to further develop Hindi as a standardised form of Hindustani separate from Urdu took form. In 1881, Bihar accepted Hindi as its sole official language, replacing Urdu, and thus became the first state of India to adopt Hindi. However, in 2014, Urdu was accorded second official language status in the state.\n\nIndependent India\nAfter independence, the Government of India instituted the following conventions:\n\nStandardisation of grammar: In 1954, the Government of India set up a committee to prepare a grammar of Hindi; The committee's report was released in 1958 as A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi.\nStandardisation of the orthography, using the Devanagari script, by the Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture to bring about uniformity in writing, to improve the shape of some Devanagari characters, and introducing diacritics to express sounds from other languages.\nOn 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted Hindi written in the Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India replacing the previous usage of Hindustani in the Perso-Arabic script in the British Indian Empire. To this end, several stalwarts rallied and lobbied pan-India in favour of Hindi, most notably Beohar Rajendra Simha along with Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Kaka Kalelkar, Maithili Sharan Gupt and Seth Govind Das who even debated in Parliament on this issue. As such, on the 50th birthday of Beohar Rajendra Simha on 14 September 1949, the efforts came to fruition following the adoption of Hindi as the official language. Now, it is celebrated as Hindi Day.\n\nOfficial status\nIndia\nPart XVII of the Indian Constitution deals with the official language of the Indian Union. Under Article 343, the official languages of the Union have been prescribed, which includes Hindi in Devanagari script and English:\n\n(1) The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorise the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devanagari form of numerals in addition to the international form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union.\nArticle 351 of the Indian constitution states:\n\nIt shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.\nIt was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Union Government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351), with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as those in Tamil Nadu) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.\nArticle 344 (2b)  stipulates that the official language commission shall be constituted every ten years to recommend steps for the progressive use of Hindi language and impose restrictions on the use of the English language by the union government. In practice, the official language commissions are constantly endeavouring to promote Hindi but not imposing restrictions on English in official use by the union government.\nAt the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following Indian states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Hindi is an official language of Gujarat, along with Gujarati. It acts as an additional official language of West Bengal in blocks and sub-divisions with more than 10% of the population speaking Hindi. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of official language in the following Union Territories:  Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.\nAlthough there is no specification of a national language in the constitution, it is a widely held belief that Hindi is the national language of India. This is often a source of friction and contentious debate. In 2010, the Gujarat High Court clarified that Hindi is not the national language of India because the constitution does not mention it as such.\n\nFiji\nOutside Asia, the Awadhi language (an Eastern Hindi dialect) with influence from Bhojpuri, Bihari languages, Fijian and English is spoken in Fiji. It is an official language in Fiji as per the 1997 Constitution of Fiji, where it referred to it as \"Hindustani\"; however, in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called \"Fiji Hindi\" as the official language. It is spoken by 380,000 people in Fiji.\n\nNepal\nHindi is spoken as a first language by about 77,569 people in Nepal according to the 2011 Nepal census, and further by 1,225,950 people as a second language. A Hindi proponent, Indian-born Paramananda Jha, was elected vice-president of Nepal. He took his oath of office in Hindi in July 2008. This created protests in the streets for 5 days; students burnt his effigies, and there was a general strike in 22 districts. Nepal Supreme Court ruled in 2009 that his oath in Hindi was invalid and he was kept \"inactive\" as vice-president. An \"angry\" Jha said, \"I cannot be compelled to take the oath now in Nepali. I might rather take it in English.\"\n\nSouth Africa\nHindi is a protected language in South Africa. According to the Constitution of South Africa, the Pan South African Language Board must promote and ensure respect for Hindi along with other languages. According to a doctoral dissertation by Rajend Mesthrie in 1985, although Hindi and other Indian languages have existed in South Africa for the last 125 years, there are no academic studies of any of them \u2013 of their use in South Africa, their evolution and current decline.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nHindi is adopted as the third official court language in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. As a result of this status, the Indian workforce in UAE can file their complaints to the labour courts in the country in their own mother-tongue.\n\nGeographical distribution\nHindi is the lingua franca of northern India (which contains the Hindi Belt), as well as an official language of the Government of India, along with English.\nIn Northeast India a pidgin known as Haflong Hindi has developed as a lingua franca for the people living in Haflong, Assam who speak other languages natively. In Arunachal Pradesh, Hindi emerged as a lingua franca among locals who speak over 50 dialects natively.\nHindi is quite easy to understand for many Pakistanis, who speak Urdu, which, like Hindi, is a standard register of the Hindustani language; additionally, Indian media are widely viewed in Pakistan.\nA sizeable population in Afghanistan, especially in Kabul, can also speak and understand Hindi-Urdu due to the popularity and influence of Bollywood films, songs and actors in the region.\nHindi is also spoken by a large population of Madheshis (people having roots in north-India but having migrated to Nepal over hundreds of years) of Nepal. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large Indian diaspora which hails from, or has its origin from the \"Hindi Belt\" of India. A substantially large North Indian diaspora lives in countries like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Fiji and Mauritius, where it is natively spoken at home and among their own Hindustani-speaking communities.\nOutside India, Hindi speakers are 8 million in Nepal; 863,077 in the United States of America; 450,170 in Mauritius; 380,000 in Fiji; 250,292 in South Africa; 150,000 in Suriname; 100,000 in Uganda; 45,800 in the United Kingdom; 20,000 in New Zealand; 20,000 in Germany; 26,000 in Trinidad and Tobago; 3,000 in Singapore.\n\nComparison with Standard Urdu\nLinguistically, Hindi and Urdu are two registers of the same language and are mutually intelligible. Both Hindi and Urdu share a core vocabulary of native Prakrit and Sanskrit-derived words. However, Hindi is written in the Devanagari script and contains more direct tatsama Sanskrit-derived words than Urdu, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and uses more Arabic and Persian loanwords compared to Hindi. Because of this, as well as the fact that the two registers share an identical grammar, a consensus of linguists consider them to be two standardised forms of the same language, Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu. Hindi is the most commonly used scheduled language in India and is one of the two official languages of the union, the other being English. Urdu is the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan and is one of 22 scheduled languages of India, also having official status in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.\n\nScript\nHindi is written in the Devanagari script, an abugida. Devanagari consists of 11 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to right. Unlike Sanskrit, Devanagari is not entirely phonetic for Hindi, especially failing to mark schwa deletion in spoken Standard Hindi.\n\nRomanisation\nThe Government of India uses Hunterian transliteration as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script. Various other systems also exist, such as IAST, ITRANS and ISO 15919.\nRomanised Hindi, also called Hinglish, is the dominant form of Hindi online. In an analysis of YouTube comments, Palakodety et al., identified that 52% of comments were in Romanised Hindi, 46% in English, and 1% in Devanagari Hindi.\n\nPhonology\nVocabulary\nTraditionally, Hindi words are divided into five principal categories according to their etymology:\n\nTatsam (\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0938\u092e transl.\u2009\"same as that\") words: These are words which are spelled the same in Hindi as in Sanskrit (except for the absence of final case inflections). They include words inherited from Sanskrit via Prakrit which have survived without modification (e.g. Hindi \u0928\u093e\u092e n\u0101m / Sanskrit \u0928\u093e\u092e n\u0101ma, \"name\", as well as forms borrowed directly from Sanskrit in more modern times (e.g. \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0928\u093e pr\u0101rthan\u0101, \"prayer\"). Pronunciation, however, conforms to Hindi norms and may differ from that of classical Sanskrit. Amongst nouns, the tatsam word could be the Sanskrit non-inflected word-stem, or it could be the nominative singular form in the Sanskrit nominal declension.\nArdhatatsam (\u0905\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0938\u092e transl.\u2009\"semi-tatsama\") words: Such words are typically earlier loanwords from Sanskrit which have undergone sound changes subsequent to being borrowed. (e.g. Hindi \u0938\u0942\u0930\u091c s\u016braj from Sanskrit \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f s\u016brya)\nTadbhav (\u0924\u0926\u094d\u092d\u0935 transl.\u2009\"born of that\") words: These are native Hindi words derived from Sanskrit after undergoing phonological rules (e.g. Sanskrit \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e karma, \"deed\" becomes Shauraseni Prakrit \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092e kamma, and eventually Hindi \u0915\u093e\u092e k\u0101m, \"work\") and are spelled differently from Sanskrit.\nDeshaj (\u0926\u0947\u0936\u091c transl.\u2009\"of the country\") words: These are words that were not borrowings from non-indigenous languages but do not derive from attested Indo-Aryan words either. Belonging to this category are onomatopoetic words or ones borrowed from local non-Indo-Aryan languages.\nVidesh\u012b (\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0936\u0940 transl.\u2009\"foreign\") words: These include all loanwords from non-indigenous languages. The most frequent source languages in this category are Persian, Arabic, English and Portuguese. Examples are \u0915\u093c\u093f\u0932\u093e qila \"fort\" from Persian, \u0915\u092e\u0947\u091f\u0940 kame\u1e6d\u012b from English committee.\n\nPrakrit\nHindi has naturally inherited a large portion of its vocabulary from Shauraseni Prakrit, in the form of tadbhava words. This process usually involves compensatory lengthening of vowels preceding consonant clusters in Prakrit, e.g. Sanskrit t\u012bk\u1e63\u1e47a > Prakrit tikkha > Hindi t\u012bkh\u0101.\n\nSanskrit\nMuch of Standard Hindi's vocabulary is borrowed from Sanskrit as tatsam borrowings, especially in technical and academic fields. The formal Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been replaced by neologisms compounding tatsam words, is called \u015auddh Hindi (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a more prestigious dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.\nExcessive use of tatsam words sometimes creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in Hindustani, causing difficulties in pronunciation.\nAs a part of the process of Sanskritisation, new words are coined using Sanskrit components to be used as replacements for supposedly foreign vocabulary. Usually these neologisms are calques of English words already adopted into spoken Hindi. Some terms such as d\u016brbh\u0101\u1e63 \"telephone\", literally \"far-speech\" and d\u016brdar\u015ban \"television\", literally \"far-sight\" have even gained some currency in formal Hindi in the place of the English borrowings (\u1e6deli)fon and \u1e6d\u012bv\u012b.\n\nPersian\nHindi also features significant Persian influence, standardised from spoken Hindustani. Early borrowings, beginning in the mid-12th century, were specific to Islam (e.g. Muhammad, Isl\u0101m) and so Persian was simply an intermediary for Arabic. Later, under the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, Persian became the primary administrative language in the Hindi heartland. Persian borrowings reached a heyday in the 17th century, pervading all aspects of life. Even grammatical constructs, namely the izafat, were assimilated into Hindi.\nThe status of Persian language then and thus its influence, is also visible in Hindi proverbs:\n\nThe emergence of Modern Standard Hindi in the 19th century went along with the Sanskritisation of its vocabulary, leading to a marginalisation of Persian vocabulary in Hindi, which continued after Partition when the Indian government co-opted the policy of Sanskritisation. However, many Persian words (e.g. bas \"enough\", khud \"self\") have remained entrenched in Standard Hindi, and a larger amount are still used in Urdu poetry written in the Devanagari script. Many words borrowed from Persian in turn were loanwords from Arabic (e.g. mu\u015bkil \"difficult\", hav\u0101 \"air\", x(a)y\u0101l \"thought\", kit\u0101b \"book\").\n\n\u0915\u093c\u093e\u0928\u0942\u0928 ultimately comes from the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd (kan\u014dn).\n\u0915\u093c\u092e\u0940\u091c\u093c ultimately comes from the Latin \"camisia\" pronunciation reinforced by Portuguese \"camisa\".\n\nEnglish\nHindi also makes extensive use of loan translation (calqueing) and occasionally phono-semantic matching of English.\n\nPortuguese\nMany Hindustani words were derived from Portuguese due to interaction with colonists and missionaries:\n\nMedia\nLiterature\nHindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being Bhakti (devotional \u2013 Kabir, Raskhan); \u015a\u1e5b\u1e47g\u0101r (beauty \u2013 Keshav, Bihari); V\u012bg\u0101th\u0101 (epic); and \u0100dhunik (modern).\nMedieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and the composition of long, epic poems. It was primarily written in other varieties of Hindi, particularly Avadhi and Braj Bhasha, but to a degree also in Delhavi, the basis for Standard Hindi. During the British Raj, Hindustani became the prestige dialect.\nChandrakanta, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi. The person who brought realism in Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Literary, or S\u0101hityik, Hindi was popularised by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular with educated people.\nThe Dvived\u012b Yug (\"Age of Dwivedi\") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing Standard Hindi in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.\nIn the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as Ch\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d (shadow-ism) and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as Ch\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b. Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Mahadevi Varma and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major Ch\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b poets.\nUttar \u0100dhunik is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the Ch\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.\n\nInternet\nHindi literature, music, and film have all been disseminated via the internet. In 2015, Google reported a 94% increase in Hindi-content consumption year-on-year, adding that 21% of users in India prefer content in Hindi. Many Hindi newspapers also offer digital editions.\n\nSample text\nThe following is a sample text in High Hindi, of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (by the United Nations):\n\nHindi in Devanagari Script\n\n\u0905\u0928\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0947\u0926 \u0967(\u090f\u0915): \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u092e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0905\u0927\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 \u0935\u0947 \u0924\u0930\u094d\u0915 \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0924\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u0915\u0940 \u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u090f\u0964\nTransliteration (ISO)\n\nAnucch\u0113d 1 (\u0113k): Sabh\u012b manu\u1e63ya janma s\u0113 svatantra tath\u0101 mary\u0101d\u0101 aur adhik\u0101r\u014d\u0303 m\u0113\u0303 sam\u0101n h\u014dt\u0113 ha\u0129.

It is an abugida, meaning that each character represents a consonant with an inherent vowel sound that can be altered with diacritics.\n   - The Government of India uses Hunterian transliteration for writing Hindi in the Latin script. Other systems include IAST, ITRANS, and ISO 15919.\n   - Romanised Hindi, or Hinglish, is prevalent online, with a significant portion of digital content being in this form.\n\n2. **Phonology and Vocabulary**:\n   - Hindi words are categorized based on their etymology:\n     - **Tatsam**: Words borrowed directly from Sanskrit with little to no modification.\n     - **Ardhatatsam**: Earlier loanwords from Sanskrit that have undergone sound changes.\n     - **Tadbhav**: Words derived from Sanskrit through Prakrit, showing phonological evolution.\n     - **Deshaj**: Indigenous words not derived from Sanskrit or foreign languages.\n     - **Videsh\u012b**: Loanwords from non-indigenous languages, primarily Persian, Arabic, English, and Portuguese.\n   - Hindi has inherited a large portion of its vocabulary from Shauraseni Prakrit and Sanskrit, with significant Persian influence due to historical interactions.\n\n3. **Grammar and Syntax**:\n   - Hindi grammar was standardized in 1954, with a report released in 1958 titled \"A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi.\"\n   - The language follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order.\n   - Hindi uses postpositions rather than prepositions, which follow the noun they govern.\n   - Verbs are conjugated based on tense, aspect, mood, and the gender and number of the subject.\n\n4. **Sample Text and Translation**:\n   - The article provides a sample text from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Devanagari script, along with its transliteration, transcription, and translation. This can serve as a reference for understanding sentence structure and vocabulary usage in formal Hindi.\n\n5. **Historical and Cultural Context**:\n   - Understanding the historical development of Hindi from Vedic Sanskrit through Prakrit and Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba is crucial for grasping the evolution of its vocabulary and grammar.\n   - The influence of Persian during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire periods is significant, as it introduced many loanwords and grammatical constructs into Hindi.\n\n6. **Official Status and Usage**:\n   - Hindi is an official language of India, used in government and education. It is also spoken in several other countries, often in different dialects or pidgin forms.\n   - The language's status and usage in various regions, such as Fiji Hindi and its role in the Indian diaspora, provide context for its global reach and variations.\n\n7. **Comparison with Urdu**:\n   - Hindi and Urdu are mutually intelligible registers of the Hindustani language, sharing core vocabulary and grammar but differing in script and certain vocabulary choices (Sanskrit-derived for Hindi, Persian/Arabic-derived for Urdu).\n\n8. **Media and Literature**:\n   - Hindi literature is diverse, with historical influences from the Bhakti movement and modern developments in prose and poetry.\n   - The internet has become a significant medium for Hindi content, with a growing preference for digital consumption in the language.\n\nBy understanding these aspects, a translator can effectively navigate the complexities of Hindi, ensuring accurate and culturally appropriate translations.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:00:29.495490"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language": {"base_content": "French (fran\u00e7ais [f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b]  or langue fran\u00e7aise [l\u0251\u0303\u0261 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z] ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. Like all other Romance languages, it descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. French evolved from Old Gallo-Romance, a descendant of the Latin spoken in Gaul, more specifically Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl\u2014languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) largely supplanted. It was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul and by the Germanic Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 16th century onward, it was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, and numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole, were established. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French.\nFrench is an official language in 27 countries, as well as one of the most geographically widespread languages in the world, with about 50 countries and territories having it as a de jure or de facto official, administrative, or cultural language. Most of these countries are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), the community of 54 member states which share the official use or teaching of French. It is estimated to have about 310 million speakers, of which about 80 million are native speakers; it is spoken as a first language (in descending order of the number of speakers) in France, Canada (provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick), Belgium (Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region), western Switzerland (Romandy region), parts of Luxembourg, parts of the United States (Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont), Monaco, the Aosta Valley region of Italy, and various communities elsewhere.\nIn Francophone Africa it is spoken mainly as a second language or lingua franca, though it has also become a native language in a small number of urban areas; in some North African countries, despite not having official status, it is also a first language among some upper classes of the population alongside the indigenous ones, but only a second one among the general population.\nIn 2015, approximately 40% of the Francophone population (including L2 and partial speakers) lived in Europe, 36% in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia and Oceania. French is the second most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union. Of Europeans who speak other languages natively, approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language. Many institutions of the EU use French as a working language along with English, German and Italian; in some institutions, French is the sole working language (e.g. at the Court of Justice of the European Union). French is also the 16th most natively spoken language in the world, the sixth most spoken language by total number of speakers, and is among the top five most studied languages worldwide, with about 120 million learners as of 2017. French has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Olympic Committee, the General Conference on Weights and Measures, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nHistory\nFrench is a Romance language (meaning that it is descended primarily from Vulgar Latin) that evolved out of the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. The language's early forms include Old French and Middle French.\n\nVulgar Latin in Gaul\nDue to Roman rule, Latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of Gaul. As the language was learned by the common people, it developed a distinct local character, with grammatical differences from Latin as spoken elsewhere, some of which is attested in graffiti. This local variety evolved into the Gallo-Romance tongues, which include French and its closest relatives, such as Arpitan.\nThe evolution of Latin in Gaul was shaped by its coexistence for over half a millennium beside the native Celtic Gaulish language, which did not go extinct until the late sixth century, long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Because few Latin speakers settled in rural areas during Roman times, Latin there held little or no social value for the landed gentry and peasantry; as a result, 90% of the total population of Gaul remained indigenous in origin. The urban aristocracy, who used Latin for trade, education or official uses, would send their children to Roman schools and administered lands for Rome. In the fifth century, at the time of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the vast majority of the (predominantly rural) population remained Gaulish speakers. They would shift to Latin as their native speech only one century after the Frankish conquest of Gaul, as both they and the new Frankish ruling elite adopted the prestige language of their urban literate elite. This eventual spread of Latin can be attributed to the social migration from the focus of urban power to village-centred economies and legal serfdom.\nThe Gaulish language likely survived into the sixth century in France despite considerable Romanization. Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French contributing loanwords and calques (including oui, the word for \"yes\"), sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence, and influences in conjugation and word order. Recent computational studies suggest that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in Gaulish.\nThe estimated number of French words that can be attributed to Gaulish is placed at 154 by the Petit Robert, which is often viewed as representing standardized French, while if non-standard dialects are included, the number increases to 240. Known Gaulish loans are skewed toward certain semantic fields, such as plant life (ch\u00eane, bille, etc.), animals (mouton, cheval, etc.), nature (boue, etc.), domestic activities (ex. berceau), farming and rural units of measure (arpent, lieue, borne, boisseau), weapons, and products traded regionally rather than further afield. This semantic distribution has been attributed to peasants being the last to hold onto Gaulish.\n\nOld French\nThe beginning of French in Gaul was greatly influenced by Germanic invasions into the country. These invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there. A language divide began to grow across the country. The population in the north spoke langue d'o\u00efl while the population in the south spoke langue d'oc. Langue d'o\u00efl grew into what is known as Old French. The period of Old French spanned between the late 8th and mid-14th centuries. Old French shared many characteristics with Latin. For example, Old French made use of different possible word orders just as Latin did because it had a case system that retained the difference between nominative subjects and oblique non-subjects. The period is marked by a heavy superstrate influence from the Germanic Frankish language, which non-exhaustively included the use in upper-class speech and higher registers of V2 word order, a large percentage of the vocabulary (now at around 15% of modern French vocabulary) including the impersonal singular pronoun on (a calque of Germanic man), and the name of the language itself.\nUp until its later stages, Old French, alongside Old Occitan, maintained a relic of the old nominal case system of Latin longer than most other Romance languages (with the notable exception of Romanian which still currently maintains a case distinction), differentiating between an oblique case and a nominative case. The phonology was characterized by heavy syllabic stress, which led to the emergence of various complicated diphthongs such as -eau which would later be leveled to monophthongs.\nThe earliest evidence of what became Old French can be seen in the Oaths of Strasbourg and the Sequence of Saint Eulalia, while Old French literature began to be produced in the eleventh century, with major early works often focusing on the lives of saints (such as the Vie de Saint Alexis), or wars and royal courts, notably including the Chanson de Roland, epic cycles focused on King Arthur and his court, as well as a cycle focused on William of Orange.\nIt was during the period of the Crusades in which French became so dominant in the Mediterranean Sea that became a lingua franca (\"Frankish language\"), and because of increased contact with the Arabs during the Crusades who referred to them as Franj, numerous Arabic loanwords entered French, such as amiral (admiral), alcool (alcohol), coton (cotton) and sirop (syrop), as well as scientific terms such as alg\u00e9bre (algebra), alchimie (alchemy) and z\u00e9ro (zero).\n\nMiddle French\nWithin Old French many dialects emerged but the Francien dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the Middle French period (14th\u201317th centuries). Modern French grew out of this Francien dialect. Grammatically, during the period of Middle French, noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules. Robert Estienne published the first Latin-French dictionary, which included information about phonetics, etymology, and grammar. Politically, the first government authority to adopt Modern French as official was the Aosta Valley in 1536, while the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats (1539) named French the language of law in the Kingdom of France.\n\nModern French\nDuring the 17th century, French replaced Latin as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations (lingua franca). It retained this role until approximately the middle of the 20th century, when it was replaced by English as the United States became the dominant global power following the Second World War. Stanley Meisler of the Los Angeles Times said that the fact that the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as French was the \"first diplomatic blow\" against the language.\nDuring the Grand Si\u00e8cle (17th century), France, under the rule of powerful leaders such as Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIV, enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among European nations. Richelieu established the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to protect the French language. By the early 1800s, Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France.\nNear the beginning of the 19th century, the French government began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minorities and regional languages (patois) spoken in France. This began in 1794 with Henri Gr\u00e9goire's \"Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language\". When public education was made compulsory, only French was taught and the use of any other (patois) language was punished. The goals of the public school system were made especially clear to the French-speaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as Occitania and Brittany. Instructions given by a French official to teachers in the department of Finist\u00e8re, in western Brittany, included the following: \"And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language\". The prefect of Basses-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es in the French Basque Country wrote in 1846: \"Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to replace the Basque language with French...\" Students were taught that their ancestral languages were inferior and they should be ashamed of them; this process was known in the Occitan-speaking region as Vergonha.\n\nGeographic distribution\nEurope\nSpoken by 19.71% of the European Union's population, French is the third most widely spoken language in the EU, after English and German and the second-most-widely taught language after English.\nUnder the Constitution of France, French has been the official language of the Republic since 1992, although the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats made it mandatory for legal documents in 1539. France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education except in specific cases, and legal contracts; advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words.\nIn Belgium, French is an official language at the federal level along with Dutch and German. At the regional level, French is the sole official language of Wallonia (excluding a part of the East Cantons, which are German-speaking) and one of the two official languages\u2014along with Dutch\u2014of the Brussels-Capital Region, where it is spoken by the majority of the population (approx. 80%), often as their primary language.\nFrench is one of the four official languages of Switzerland, along with German, Italian, and Romansh, and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland, called Romandy, of which Geneva is the largest city. The language divisions in Switzerland do not coincide with political subdivisions, and some cantons have bilingual status: for example, cities such as Biel/Bienne and cantons such as Valais, Fribourg and Bern. French is the native language of about 23% of the Swiss population, and is spoken by 50% of the population.\nAlong with Luxembourgish and German, French is one of the three official languages of Luxembourg, where it is generally the preferred language of business as well as of the different public administrations. It is also the official language of Monaco.\nAt a regional level, French is acknowledged as an official language in the Aosta Valley region of Italy (the first government authority to adopt Modern French as the official language in 1536, three years before France itself), in which is spoken as a first language by 1.25% of the population and as a second one by approximately 50%. French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands; it is also spoken in Andorra and is the main language after Catalan in El Pas de la Casa. The language is taught as the primary second language in the German state of Saarland, with French being taught from pre-school and over 43% of citizens being able to speak French.\n\nAfrica\nThe majority of the world's French-speaking population lives in Africa; while it is an official language in 18 countries, it is not spoken as a first language by the majority, acting mainly as a second one or a lingua franca due to the many indigenous languages spoken in the territories. According to a 2023 estimate from the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, an estimated 167 million African people spread across 35 countries and territories can speak French as either a first or a second language. This number does not include the people living in non-Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language. Due to the rise of French in Africa, the total French-speaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050. French was the fastest growing language on the continent (in terms of either official or foreign languages).\nWhile spoken mainly as a second language, French is increasingly being spoken as a native language in Francophone Africa among some communities in urban areas or the elite class, especially in the cities of Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Douala in Cameroon, Libreville in Gabon, and Antananarivo in Madagascar. However, some African countries such as Algeria intermittently attempted to remove the use of French in favor of native languages, and it was removed as an official language in Mali and Burkina Faso in 2023 and 2024 respectevely.\nThere is not a single African French, but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages.\nSub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth. It is also where the language has evolved the most in recent years. Some vernacular forms of French in Africa can be difficult to understand for French speakers from other countries, but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French-speaking world.\n\nAmericas\nCanada\nFrench is the second most commonly spoken language in Canada and one of two federal official languages alongside English. As of the 2021 Canadian census, it was the native language of 7.7 million people (21% of the population) and the second language of 2.9 million (8% of the population). French is the sole official language in the province of Quebec, where some 80% of the population speak it as a native language and 95% are capable of conducting a conversation in it. Quebec is also home to the city of Montreal, which is the world's fourth-largest French-speaking city, by number of first language speakers. New Brunswick and Manitoba are the only officially bilingual provinces, though full bilingualism is enacted only in New Brunswick, where about one third of the population is Francophone. French is also an official language of all of the territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon). Out of the three, Yukon has the most French speakers, making up just under 4% of the population. Furthermore, while French is not an official language in Ontario, the French Language Services Act ensures that provincial services are available in the language. The Act applies to areas of the province where there are significant Francophone communities, namely Eastern Ontario and Northern Ontario. Elsewhere, sizable French-speaking minorities are found in southern Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Port au Port Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the unique Newfoundland French dialect was historically spoken. Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces. The Ontarian city of Ottawa, the Canadian capital, is also effectively bilingual, as it has a large population of federal government workers, who are required to offer services in both French and English, and is just across the river from the Quebecois city of Gatineau.\n\nUnited States\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau (2011), French is the fourth most spoken language in the United States after English, Spanish, and Chinese, when all forms of French are considered together and all dialects of Chinese are similarly combined. French is the second-most spoken language (after English) in the states of Maine and New Hampshire. In Louisiana, it is tied with Spanish for second-most spoken if Louisiana French and all creoles such as Haitian are included. French is the third most spoken language (after English and Spanish) in the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire. Louisiana is home to many distinct French dialects, collectively known as Louisiana French. New England French, essentially a variant of Canadian French, is spoken in parts of New England. Missouri French was historically spoken in Missouri and Illinois (formerly known as Upper Louisiana), but is nearly extinct today. French also survived in isolated pockets along the Gulf Coast of what was previously French Lower Louisiana, such as Mon Louis Island, Alabama and DeLisle, Mississippi (the latter only being discovered by linguists in the 1990s) but these varieties are severely endangered or presumed extinct.\n\nCaribbean\nFrench is one of two official languages in Haiti alongside Haitian Creole. It is the principal language of education, administration, business, and public signage and is spoken by all educated Haitians. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations, and church masses. The vast majority of the population speaks Haitian Creole as their first language; the rest largely speak French as a first language. As a French Creole language, Haitian Creole draws the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages. It is closely related to Louisiana Creole and the creole from the Lesser Antilles.\nFrench is the sole official language of all the overseas territories of France in the Caribbean that are collectively referred to as the French West Indies, namely Guadeloupe, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, and Martinique.\n\nOther territories\nFrench is the official language of both French Guiana on the South American continent, and of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, an archipelago off the coast of Newfoundland in North America.\n\nAsia\nSoutheast Asia\nFrench was the official language of the colony of French Indochina, comprising modern-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It continues to be an administrative language in Laos and Cambodia, although its influence has waned in recent decades. In colonial Vietnam, the elites primarily spoke French, while many servants who worked in French households spoke a French pidgin known as \"T\u00e2y B\u1ed3i\" (now extinct). After French rule ended, South Vietnam continued to use French in administration, education, and trade. However, since the Fall of Saigon and the opening of a unified Vietnam's economy, French has gradually been effectively displaced as the first foreign language of choice by English in Vietnam. Nevertheless, it continues to be taught as the other main foreign language in the Vietnamese educational system and is regarded as a cultural language.\nAll three countries are full members of La Francophonie (OIF).\n\nIndia\nFrench was the official language of French India, consisting of the geographically separate enclaves referred to as Puducherry. It continued to be an official language of the territory even after its cession to India in 1956 until 1965. A small number of older locals still retain knowledge of the language, although it has now given way to Tamil and English.\n\nLebanon\nA former French mandate, Lebanon designates Arabic as the sole official language, while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used. Article 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that \"Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used\". The French language in Lebanon is a widespread second language among the Lebanese people, and is taught in many schools along with Arabic and English. French is used on Lebanese pound banknotes, on road signs, on Lebanese license plates, and on official buildings (alongside Arabic).\nToday, French and English are secondary languages of Lebanon, with about 40% of the population being Francophone and 40% Anglophone. The use of English is growing in the business and media environment. Out of about 900,000 students, about 500,000 are enrolled in Francophone schools, public or private, in which the teaching of mathematics and scientific subjects is provided in French. Actual usage of French varies depending on the region and social status. One-third of high school students educated in French go on to pursue higher education in English-speaking institutions. English is the language of business and communication, with French being an element of social distinction, chosen for its emotional value.\n\nOceania and Australia\nFrench is an official language of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, where 31% of the population was estimated to speak it in 2023. In the French special collectivity of New Caledonia, 97% of the population can speak, read and write French while in French Polynesia this figure is 95%, and in the French collectivity of Wallis and Futuna, it is 84%.\nIn French Polynesia and to a lesser extent Wallis and Futuna, where oral and written knowledge of the French language has become almost universal (95% and 84% respectively), French increasingly tends to displace the native Polynesian languages as the language most spoken at home. In French Polynesia, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 67% at the 2007 census to 74% at the 2017 census. In Wallis and Futuna, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 10% at the 2008 census to 13% at the 2018 census.\n\nFuture\nAccording to a demographic projection led by the Universit\u00e9 Laval and the R\u00e9seau D\u00e9mographie de l'Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, the total number of French speakers will reach approximately 500 million in 2025 and 650 million by 2050, largely due to rapid population growth in sub-Saharan Africa. OIF estimates 700 million French speakers by 2050, 80% of whom will be in Africa.\nIn a study published in March 2014 by Forbes, the investment bank Natixis said that French could become the world's most spoken language by 2050.\nIn the European Union, French was the dominant language within all institutions until the 1990s. After several enlargements of the EU (1995, 2004), French significantly lost ground in favour of English, which is more widely spoken and taught in most EU countries. French currently remains one of the three working languages, or \"procedural languages\", of the EU, along with English and German. It is the second-most widely used language within EU institutions after English, but remains the preferred language of certain institutions or administrations such as the Court of Justice of the European Union, where it is the sole internal working language, or the Directorate-General for Agriculture. Since 2016, Brexit has rekindled discussions on whether or not French should again hold greater role within the institutions of the European Union.\n\nVarieties\nCurrent status and importance\nAccording to the OIF, approximately 321 million people worldwide are \"able to speak the language\" as of 2022, without specifying the criteria for this estimation or whom it encompasses. A leading world language, French is taught in universities around the world, and is one of the world's most influential languages because of its wide use in the worlds of journalism, jurisprudence, education, and diplomacy.\nIn diplomacy, French is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (and one of the UN Secretariat's only two working languages), one of twenty official and three procedural languages of the European Union, an official language of NATO, the International Olympic Committee, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Organization of American States (alongside Spanish, Portuguese and English), the Eurovision Song Contest, one of eighteen official languages of the European Space Agency, World Trade Organization and the least used of the three official languages in the North American Free Trade Agreement countries. It is also a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the Red Cross (alongside English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Russian), Amnesty International (alongside 32 other languages of which English is the most used, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian), M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (used alongside English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic), and M\u00e9decins du Monde (used alongside English). Given the demographic prospects of the French-speaking nations of Africa, researcher Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wrote in 2014 that French \"could be the language of the future\". However, some African countries such as Algeria intermittently attempted to eradicate the use of French, and as of 2024 it was removed as an official language in Mali and Burkina Faso.\nSignificant as a judicial language, French is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts, tribunals, and dispute-settlement bodies as the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Caribbean Court of Justice, the Court of Justice for the Economic Community of West African States, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea the International Criminal Court and the World Trade Organization Appellate Body. It is the sole internal working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and makes with English the European Court of Human Rights's two working languages.\nIn 1997, George Weber published, in Language Today, a comprehensive academic study entitled \"The World's 10 most influential languages\". In the article, Weber ranked French as, after English, the second-most influential language of the world, ahead of Spanish. His criteria were the numbers of native speakers, the number of secondary speakers (especially high for French among fellow world languages), the number of countries using the language and their respective populations, the economic power of the countries using the language, the number of major areas in which the language is used, and the linguistic prestige associated with the mastery of the language (Weber highlighted that French in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige). In a 2008 reassessment of his article, Weber concluded that his findings were still correct since \"the situation among the top ten remains unchanged.\"\nKnowledge of French is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the United Kingdom; a 2014 study found that 50% of British managers considered French to be a valuable asset for their business, thus ranking French as the most sought-after foreign language there, ahead of German (49%) and Spanish (44%). MIT economist Albert Saiz calculated a 2.3% premium for those who have French as a foreign language in the workplace.\nIn 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese.\nIn English-speaking Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, French is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages. In the United States, French is the second-most commonly taught foreign language in schools and universities, although well behind Spanish. In some areas of the country near French-speaking Quebec, however, it is the foreign language more commonly taught.\n\nPhonology\nVowel phonemes in French\n\nAlthough there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language.\n\nThere are a maximum of 17 vowels in French, not all of which are used in every dialect: /a/, /\u0251/, /e/, /\u025b/, /\u025b\u02d0/, /\u0259/, /i/, /o/, /\u0254/, /y/, /u/, /\u0153/, /\u00f8/, plus the nasalized vowels /\u0251\u0303/, /\u025b\u0303/, /\u0254\u0303/ and /\u0153\u0303/. In France, the vowels /\u0251/, /\u025b\u02d0/ and /\u0153\u0303/ are tending to be replaced by /a/, /\u025b/ and /\u025b\u0303/ in many people's speech, but the distinction of /\u025b\u0303/ and /\u0153\u0303/ is present in Meridional French. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels /\u0251/, /\u0259/, /\u025b\u02d0/ and /\u0153\u0303/ are present.\nVoiced stops (i.e., /b, d, \u0261/) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\nVoiceless stops (i.e., /p, t, k/) are unaspirated.\nThe velar nasal /\u014b/ can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: parking, camping, swing.\nThe palatal nasal /\u0272/, which is written \u27e8gn\u27e9, can occur in word initial position (e.g., gnon), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., montagne).\nFrench has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental /f/~/v/, dental /s/~/z/, and palato-alveolar /\u0283/~/\u0292/. /s/~/z/ are dental, like the plosives /t/~/d/ and the nasal /n/.\nFrench has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a voiced uvular fricative, as in [\u0281u] roue, \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., fort), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill [r] occurs in some dialects. The cluster /\u0281w/ is generally pronounced as a labialised voiced uvular fricative [\u0281\u02b7], such as in [\u0281\u02b7a] roi, \"king\", or [k\u0281\u02b7a\u0281] croire, \"to believe\".\nLateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant /l/ is unvelarised in both onset (lire) and coda position (il). In the onset, the central approximants [w], [\u0265], and [j] each correspond to a high vowel, /u/, /y/, and /i/ respectively. There are a few minimal pairs where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between /j/ and /i/ occur in final position as in /p\u025bj/ paye, \"pay\", vs. /p\u025bi/ pays, \"country\".\nThe lateral approximant /l/ can be delateralised when word- or morpheme-final and preceded by /i/, such as in /t\u0281avaj/ travail, \"work\", or when a word ending in \u27e8al\u27e9 is pluralised, giving \u27e8aux\u27e9 /o/.\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n\nFinal single consonants, in particular s, x, z, t, d, n, p and g, are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters f, k, q, and l, however, are normally pronounced. The final c is sometimes pronounced like in bac, sac, roc but can also be silent like in blanc or estomac. The final r is usually silent when it follows an e in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (hiver, super, cancer etc.).\nWhen the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant may once again be pronounced, to provide a liaison or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are mandatory, for example the s in les amants or vous avez; some are optional, depending on dialect and register, for example, the first s in deux cents euros or euros irlandais; and some are forbidden, for example, the s in beaucoup d'hommes aiment. The t of et is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in set phrases like pied-\u00e0-terre.\nDoubling a final n and adding a silent e at the end of a word (e.g., chien \u2192 chienne) makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final l and adding a silent e (e.g., gentil \u2192 gentille) adds a [j] sound if the l is preceded by the letter i.\nSome monosyllabic function words ending in a or e, such as je and que, drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a hiatus). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., *je ai is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 j'ai). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for l'homme qu'il a vu (\"the man whom he saw\") and l'homme qui l'a vu (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in Quebec French, the second example (l'homme qui l'a vu) is more emphasized on l'a vu.\n\nWriting system\nAlphabet\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic Latin script, with four diacritics appearing on vowels (circumflex accent, acute accent, grave accent, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in \"\u00e7\".\nThere are two ligatures, \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are often replaced in contemporary French with \"oe\" and \"ae\", because the ligatures do not appear on the AZERTY keyboard layout used in French-speaking countries. However this is nonstandard in formal and literary texts.\n\nOrthography\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n\nOld French doit > French doigt \"finger\" (Latin digitus)\nOld French pie > French pied \"foot\" [Latin pes (stem: ped-)]\nFrench orthography is morphophonemic. While it contains 130 graphemes that denote only 36 phonemes, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes. Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how tomber and tomb\u00e9 both end with the /e/ phoneme. Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the x in paix is not pronounced though at the end of Aix it is.\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see Liaison (French)). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: pied, aller, les, finit, beaux. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: beaux-arts, les amis, pied-\u00e0-terre.\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for animal was animals. The /als/ sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong /aus/. This change was then reflected in the orthography: animaus. The us ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter x, resulting in a written form animax. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of au turned into /o/ so that the u was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French animaux (pronounced first /animos/ before the final /s/ was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for cheval pluralized as chevaux and many others. In addition, castel pl. castels became ch\u00e2teau pl. ch\u00e2teaux.\n\nNasal: n and m. When n or m follows a vowel or diphthong, the n or m becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the n or m is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes en- and em- are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\nDigraphs: French uses not only diacritics to specify its large range of vowel sounds and diphthongs, but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\nGemination: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, illusion is pronounced [ilyzj\u0254\u0303] and not [il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]. However, gemination does occur between words; for example, une info (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced [yn\u025b\u0303fo], whereas une nympho (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced [yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo].\nAccents are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\nAccents that affect pronunciation\nThe acute accent (l'accent aigu) \u00e9 (e.g., \u00e9cole\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced /e/ instead of the default /\u0259/.\nThe grave accent (l'accent grave) \u00e8 (e.g., \u00e9l\u00e8ve\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced /\u025b/ instead of the default /\u0259/.\nThe circumflex (l'accent circonflexe) \u00ea (e.g. for\u00eat\u2014forest) shows that an e is pronounced /\u025b/ and that an \u00f4 is pronounced /o/. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of /\u0251/ for the letter \u00e2, but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of s after a vowel, where that letter s was not pronounced. Thus, forest became for\u00eat, hospital became h\u00f4pital, and hostel became h\u00f4tel.\nDiaeresis or tr\u00e9ma (\u00eb, \u00ef, \u00fc, \u00ff): over e, i, u or y, indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: na\u00efve, No\u00ebl.\nThe combination of e with diaeresis following o (No\u00ebl [\u0254\u025b]) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by n (Samo\u00ebns [w\u025b\u0303])\nThe combination of e with diaeresis following a is either pronounced [\u025b] (Rapha\u00ebl, Isra\u00ebl [a\u025b]) or not pronounced, leaving only the a (Sta\u00ebl [a]) and the a is nasalized in the regular way if a\u00eb is followed by n (Saint-Sa\u00ebns [\u0251\u0303])\nA diaeresis on y only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which \u00ff appears include A\u00ff (a commune in Marne, formerly A\u00ff-Champagne), Rue des Clo\u00ffs (an alley in Paris), Cro\u00ff (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), Ch\u00e2teau du Fa\u00ff (near Pontoise), Gh\u00ffs (name of Flemish origin spelt Gh\u0133s where \u0133 in handwriting looked like \u00ff to French clerks), L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses (commune near Paris), Pierre Lou\u00ffs (author), Mo\u00ff-de-l'Aisne (commune in Aisne and a family name), and Le Blanc de Nicola\u00ff (an insurance company in eastern France).\nThe diaeresis on u appears in the Biblical proper names Arch\u00e9la\u00fcs, Capharna\u00fcm, Emma\u00fcs, \u00c9sa\u00fc, and Sa\u00fcl, as well as French names such as Ha\u00fcy. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing gu\u00eb (such as aigu\u00eb or cigu\u00eb) may be moved onto the u: aig\u00fce, cig\u00fce, and by analogy may be used in verbs such as j'arg\u00fce.\nIn addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (\u00e4, \u00f6 and \u00fc) if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as K\u00e4rcher (trademark of a pressure washer).\nThe cedilla (la c\u00e9dille) \u00e7 (e.g., gar\u00e7on\u2014boy) means that the letter \u00e7 is pronounced /s/ in front of the back vowels a, o and u (c is otherwise /k/ before a back vowel). C is always pronounced /s/ in front of the front vowels e, i, and y, thus \u00e7 is never found in front of front vowels. This letter is used when a front vowel after \u27e8c\u27e9, such as in France or placer, is replaced with a back vowel. To retain the pronunciation of the \u27e8c\u27e9, it is given a cedilla, as in fran\u00e7ais or pla\u00e7ons.\nAccents with no pronunciation effect\nThe circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters i or u, nor, in most dialects, a. It usually indicates that an s came after it long ago, as in \u00eele (from former isle, compare with English word \"isle\"). The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, dites (you say) / d\u00eetes (you said), or even du (of the) / d\u00fb (past participle for the verb devoir = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\nAll other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs l\u00e0 and o\u00f9 (\"there\", \"where\") from the article la (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ou (\"or\"), respectively.\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.\nIn 1990, a reform accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.\n\nGrammar\nFrench is a moderately inflected language. Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); adjectives, for number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns and a few other pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for tense, aspect, mood, and the person and number of their subjects. Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n\nthe loss of Latin declensions\nthe loss of the neuter gender\nthe development of grammatical articles from Latin demonstratives\nthe loss of certain Latin tenses and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.\n\nNouns\nEvery French noun is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is an enseignant while a female teacher is an enseignante. However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be enseignants. A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be enseignants. However, a group of two female teachers would be enseignantes. In many situations, including in the case of enseignant, both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular le professeur or la professeure (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural les professeur(e)s because le /l\u0259/, la /la/, and les /le(s)/ are all pronounced differently. With enseignant, however, for both singular forms the le/la becomes l', and so the only difference in pronunciation is that the \u27e8t\u27e9 on the end of masculine form is silent, whereas it is pronounced in the feminine. If the word was to be followed by a word starting with a vowel, then liaison would cause the \u27e8t\u27e9 to be pronounced in both forms, resulting in identical pronunciation. There are also some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, le dentiste refers to a male dentist while la dentiste refers to a female dentist. Furthermore, a few nouns' meanings depend on their gender. For example, un livre (masculine) refers to a book, while une livre a (feminine) is a pound.\n\nVerbs\nMoods and tense-aspect forms\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the indicative mood (indicatif), the subjunctive mood (subjonctif), the imperative mood (imp\u00e9ratif), and the conditional mood (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the infinitive mood (infinitif), the present participle (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the past participle (participe pass\u00e9).\n\nFinite moods\nIndicative (indicatif)\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the present (pr\u00e9sent), the simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and pass\u00e9 simple), the past imperfective (imparfait), the pluperfect (plus-que-parfait), the simple future (futur simple), the future perfect (futur ant\u00e9rieur), and the past perfect (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n\nSubjunctive (subjonctif)\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n\nImperative (imperatif)\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense). The imperative is used to give commands to you (tu), we/us (nous), and plural you (vous).\n\nConditional (conditionnel)\nThe conditional makes use of the present (pr\u00e9sent) and the past (pass\u00e9).\nThe pass\u00e9 uses auxiliary verbs in its forms.\n\nVoice\nFrench uses both the active voice and the passive voice. The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb \u00eatre (\"to be\") and the past participle.\nExample of the active voice:\n\n\"Elle aime le chien.\" She loves the dog.\n\"Marc a conduit la voiture.\" Marc drove the car.\nExample of the passive voice:\n\n\"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" The dog is loved by her.\n\"La voiture a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite par Marc.\" The car was driven by Marc.\nHowever, unless the subject of the sentence is specified, generally the pronoun on \"one\" is used:\n\n\"On aime le chien.\" The dog is loved. (Literally \"one loves the dog.\")\n\"On conduit la voiture.\" The car is (being) driven. (Literally \"one drives the car.\")\nWord order is subject\u2013verb\u2013object although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular inversion of the subject and verb, as in \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" when asking a question rather than \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both formulations are used, and carry a rising inflection on the last word. The literal English translations are \"Do you speak French?\" and \"You speak French?\", respectively. To avoid inversion while asking a question, \"Est-ce que\" (literally \"is it that\") may be placed at the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses verb\u2013object\u2013subject (VOS) and object\u2013subject\u2013verb (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.\n\nVocabulary\nThe majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots. In many cases, a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from Classical Latin. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n\nbrother: fr\u00e8re / fraternel from Latin frater / fraternalis\nfinger: doigt / digital from Latin digitus / digitalis\nfaith: foi / fid\u00e8le from Latin fides / fidelis\neye: \u0153il / oculaire from Latin oculus / ocularis\nHowever, a historical tendency to Gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n\nrayonnement / radiation from Latin radiatio\n\u00e9teindre / extinguish from Latin exstinguere\nnoyau / nucleus from Latin nucleus\nensoleillement / insolation from Latin insolatio\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n\nthing/cause: chose / cause from Latin causa\ncold: froid / frigide from Latin frigidum\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words because in the evolution from Vulgar Latin, unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\nMore recently (1994) the linguistic policy (Toubon Law) of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules. The result is often two (or more) co-existing terms for describing the same phenomenon.\n\nmercatique / marketing\nfinance fant\u00f4me / shadow banking\nbloc-notes / notepad\naili\u00e8re / wingsuit\ntiers-lieu / coworking\nIt is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the Petit Larousse or Micro-Robert Plus (35,000 words) are of foreign origin (where Greek and Latin learned words are not seen as foreign). About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from Italian, 550 from ancient Germanic languages, 481 from other Gallo-Romance languages, 215 from Arabic, 164 from German, 160 from Celtic languages, 159 from Spanish, 153 from Dutch, 112 from Persian and Sanskrit, 101 from Native American languages, 89 from other Asian languages, 56 from other Afro-Asiatic languages, 55 from Balto-Slavic languages, 10 from Basque and 144 (about 3%) from other languages.\nOne study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin estimated that among the languages analyzed French has the greatest distance from Latin. The French language's lexical similarity to a selection of other Romance languages is 89% with Italian, 80% with Sardinian, 78% with Rhaeto-Romance, and 75% with Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nNumerals\nThe numeral system used in the majority of Francophone countries employs both decimal and vigesimal counting. After the use of unique names for the numbers 1\u201316, those from 17 to 69 are counted by tens, while twenty (vingt) is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 70 to 99. The French word for 80 is quatre-vingts, literally \"four twenties\", and the word for 75 is soixante-quinze, literally \"sixty-fifteen\". The vigesimal method of counting is analogous to the archaic English use of score, as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\nBelgian, Swiss, and Aostan French as well as that used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, use different names for 70 and 90, namely septante and nonante. In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be quatre-vingts (Geneva, Neuch\u00e2tel, Jura) or huitante (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg). The Aosta Valley similarly uses huitante for 80. Conversely, Belgium and in its former African colonies use quatre-vingts for 80.\nIn Old French (during the Middle Ages), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. vint et doze (twenty and twelve) for 32, dous vinz et diz (two twenties and ten) for 50, uitante for 80, or nonante for 90.\nThe term octante was historically used in Switzerland for 80, but is now considered archaic.\nFrench, like most European languages, uses a space to separate thousands. The comma (French: virgule) is used in French numbers as a decimal point, i.e. \"2,5\" instead of \"2.5\". In the case of currencies, the currency markers are substituted for decimal point, i.e. \"5$7\" for \"5 dollars and 7 cents\".\n\nExample text\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in French:\n\nTous les \u00eatres humains naissent libres et \u00e9gaux en dignit\u00e9 et en droits. Ils sont dou\u00e9s de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternit\u00e9.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English:\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\n\nSee also\nAlliance Fran\u00e7aise\nAZERTY\nFran\u00e7ais fondamental\nFrancization\nFrancophile\nFrancophobia\nFrancophonie\nFrench language in the United States\nFrench language in Canada\nFrench poetry\nGlossary of French expressions in English\nInfluence of French on English\nLanguage education\nList of countries where French is an official language\nList of English words of French origin\nList of French loanwords in Persian\nList of French words and phrases used by English speakers\nList of German words of French origin\nOfficial bilingualism in Canada\nVarieties of French\n\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\nLa langue fran\u00e7aise dans le monde 2014 (PDF) (in French).

French Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "ai_summary": "To effectively translate text into French, it is crucial to understand the language's grammar, phonology, orthography, and vocabulary. Here is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article on the French language:\n\n### Grammar\n\n#### Nouns\n- **Gender**: Every French noun is either masculine or feminine. The gender of nouns referring to living beings often corresponds to the gender of the entity (e.g., \"enseignant\" for a male teacher and \"enseignante\" for a female teacher).\n- **Pluralization**: Plural nouns are typically formed by adding an \"s\" to the singular form, though this is often silent in pronunciation. Articles change to indicate plural (e.g., \"le\" or \"la\" becomes \"les\").\n\n#### Verbs\n- **Moods and Tenses**: French verbs are conjugated in various moods and tenses:\n  - **Indicative Mood**: Includes present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and pass\u00e9 simple), past imperfective (imparfait), pluperfect (plus-que-parfait), simple future (futur simple), future perfect (futur ant\u00e9rieur), and past perfect (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur).\n  - **Subjunctive Mood**: Includes present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n  - **Imperative Mood**: Used for commands, primarily in the present tense.\n  - **Conditional Mood**: Includes present (pr\u00e9sent) and past (pass\u00e9).\n- **Voice**: French uses both active and passive voices. The passive voice is formed using a form of \"\u00eatre\" (to be) and the past participle.\n\n#### Word Order\n- **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)**: Standard word order, though pronoun objects precede the verb.\n- **Inversion**: Used in questions (e.g., \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\").\n- **Est-ce que**: Used to form questions without inversion (e.g., \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais?\").\n\n### Phonology\n\n- **Vowels**: French has up to 17 vowels, including nasalized vowels. Not all vowels are used in every dialect.\n- **Consonants**: Voiced stops are fully voiced, and voiceless stops are unaspirated. The language includes nasal and palatal sounds.\n- **Liaisons**: Silent consonants may be pronounced when followed by a vowel, creating a liaison between words.\n\n### Orthography\n\n- **Alphabet**: Uses the 26 letters of the Latin script, with diacritics like the circumflex, acute, grave, diaeresis, and cedilla.\n- **Ligatures**: \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\" are often replaced with \"oe\" and \"ae\" in modern texts.\n- **Accents**: Affect pronunciation and can distinguish between homophones (e.g., \"\u00e9\" is pronounced /e/).\n- **Silent Letters**: Final consonants are often silent unless followed by a vowel.\n\n### Vocabulary\n\n- **Latin Roots**: Many French words derive from Vulgar Latin, with both \"popular\" and \"learned\" forms.\n- **Foreign Influence**: French has borrowed words from English, Italian, Germanic languages, Arabic, and others.\n- **Numerals**: Uses both decimal and vigesimal systems, with unique terms for numbers like 70 (soixante-dix) and 80 (quatre-vingts).\n\n### Example Text\n\n- **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**: Provides a sample of formal French text for reference.\n\nThis information provides a comprehensive foundation for translating text into French, covering essential aspects of grammar, pronunciation, spelling, and vocabulary. Understanding these elements will aid in producing accurate and contextually appropriate translations.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:00:49.887193"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_language": {"base_content": "Igbo (English:  EE-boh, US also  I-gboh; Standard Igbo: \u00c1s\u1ee5\u0300s\u1ee5\u0301 \u00ccgb\u00f2 [\u00e1s\u028a\u0300s\u028a\u0300 \u00ec\u0261\u0361b\u00f2] ) is the principal native language cluster of the Igbo people, an ethnicity in the Southeastern part of Nigeria.\nIgbo languages are spoken by a total of 31 million people. The number of Igboid languages depends on how one classifies a language versus a dialect, so there could be around 35 different Igbo languages. The core Igbo cluster, or Igbo proper, is generally thought to be one language but there is limited mutual intelligibility between the different groupings (north, west, south and east). A standard literary language termed 'Igbo izugbe' (meaning \"general igbo\") was generically developed and later adopted around 1972, with its core foundation based on the Orlu (Isu dialects), Anambra (Awka dialects) and Umuahia (Ohuhu dialects), omitting the nasalization and aspiration of those varieties.\n\nHistory\nThe first book to publish Igbo terms was History of the Mission of the Evangelical Brothers in the Caribbean (German: Geschichte der Mission der Evangelischen Br\u00fcder auf den Carabischen Inseln), published in 1777. Shortly afterwards in 1789, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano was published in London, England, written by Olaudah Equiano, who was a former slave, featuring 79 Igbo words. The narrative also illustrated various aspects of Igbo life in detail, based on Equiano's experiences in his hometown of Essaka. Following the British Niger Expeditions of 1854 and 1857, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, published an Igbo primer coded by a young Igbo missionary named Simon Jonas, who travelled with him to Aboh in 1857.\nThe language was standardized in church usage by the Union Igbo Bible (1913).\nCentral Igbo, is based on the dialects of two members of the Ezinifite group of Igbo in Central Owerri Province between the towns of Owerri and Umuahia in Eastern Nigeria. From its proposal as a literary form in 1939 by Ida C. Ward, it was gradually accepted by missionaries, writers, and publishers across the region.\nStandard Igbo aims to cross-pollinate Central Igbo with words from other Igbo dialects, with the adoption of loan words.\nChinua Achebe passionately denounced language standardization efforts, beginning with Union Igbo through to Central and finally Standard Igbo, in a 1999 lecture sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Owerri.\n\nDistribution\nIgbo (and its dialects) is the dominant language in the following Nigerian states:\n\nAbia State\nAnambra State\nEbonyi State\nEnugu State\nImo State\nNorthern Delta State\nRivers State\n\nVocabulary\nWord classes\nLexical categories in Igbo include nouns, pronouns, numerals, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, and a single preposition. The meaning of na, the single preposition, is flexible and must be ascertained from the context. Examples from Emenanjo (2015) illustrate the range of meaning:\n\nIgbo has an extremely limited number of adjectives in a closed class. Emenanjo (1978, 2015) counts just eight, which occur in pairs of opposites: ukwu 'big', nta 'small'; oji 'dark', \u1ecdcha 'light'; \u1ecdh\u1ee5r\u1ee5 'new', ochie 'old'; \u1ecdma 'good'; nj\u1ecd 'bad'. Adjectival meaning is otherwise conveyed through the use of stative verbs or abstract nouns.\nVerbs, by far the most prominent category in Igbo, host most of the language's morphology and appear to be the most basic category; many processes can derive new words from verbs, but few can derive verbs from words of other classes.\nIgbo pronouns do not index gender, and the same pronouns are used for male, female and inanimate beings. So the sentence, \u1ecd maka can mean \"he, she or it is beautiful\".\n\nPhonology\nVowels\nIgbo is a tonal language. Tone varies by dialect but in most dialects there seem to be three register tones and three contour tones. The language's tone system was given by John Goldsmith as an example of autosegmental phenomena that go beyond the linear model of phonology laid out in The Sound Pattern of English. Igbo words may differ only in tone. An example is \u00e1kw\u00e1 \"cry\", \u00e0kw\u00e0 \"bed\", \u00e0kw\u00e1 \"egg\", and \u00e1kw\u00e0 \"cloth\". As tone is not normally written, these all appear as \u27e8akwa\u27e9 in print.\nIn many cases, the two (or sometimes three) tones commonly used in Igbo dictionaries fail to represent how words actually sound in the spoken language . This indicates that Igbo may have many more tones than previously recognised. For example, the imperative form of the word bia \"come\" has a different tone to that used in statement O bia \"he came\". That imperative tone is also used in the second syllable of abuo \"two\". Another distinct tone appears in the second syllable of asaa \"seven\" and another in the second syllable of aguu \"hunger\".\n\nThe language features vowel harmony with two sets of oral vowels distinguished by pharyngeal cavity size described in terms of retracted tongue root (RTR). These vowels also occupy different places in vowel space: [i \u026a\u0319 e a u \u028a\u0319 o \u0252\u0319] (the last commonly transcribed [\u0254\u0319], in keeping with neighboring languages). For simplicity, phonemic transcriptions typically choose only one of these parameters to be distinctive, either RTR as in the chart on the right and Igbo orthography (that is, as /i i\u0319 e a u u\u0319 o o\u0319/), or vowel space as in the alphabetic chart below (that is, as /i \u026a e a u \u028a o \u0254/). There are also nasal vowels.\nAdjacent vowels usually undergo assimilation during speech. The sound of a preceding vowel, usually at the end of one word, merges in a rapid transition to the sound of the following vowel, particularly at the start of another word, giving the second vowel greater prominence in speech. Usually the first vowel (in the first word) is only slightly identifiable to listeners, usually undergoing centralisation. /k\u00e0 \u00f3 m\u00e9sj\u00e1/, for example, becomes /k\u00f2\u00f3 m\u00e9sj\u00e1/ \"goodbye\". An exception to this assimilation may be with words ending in /a/ such as /n\u00e0/ in /n\u00e0 \u00e0l\u00e0/, \"on the ground\", which could be completely assimilated leaving /n/ in rapid speech, as in \"n\u00e0l\u00e0\" or \"n'\u00e0l\u00e0\". In other dialects however, the instance of /a/ such as in \"n\u00e0\" in /\u1ecd\u0301 n\u00e0 \u00e8r\u00ed \u0144r\u00ed/, \"he/she/it is eating\", results in a long vowel, /\u1ecd\u0301 n\u00e8\u00e8r\u00ed \u0144r\u00ed/.\n\nTone\nThe Igbo language is tonal in nature. This means that the meaning of a word can be altered depending on the tone used when pronouncing it. Igbo has two main tones: high and low. The high tone is usually marked with an acute accent (\u00b4) and the low tone is marked with a grave accent (`).\nFor example, the word \u27e8akwa\u27e9 can mean \"cry, egg, cloth, sew\" depending on the tone used. If pronounced with a high tone on the first and last syllable it means \"cry\". But if pronounced with a low tone on the first syllable and high on the last syllable, it means \"egg\u201d. If it is pronounced with low tone on both syllables, then it will mean \u201ccloth\u201d or \u201csew\u201d.\n\nAnother example is the word \"eze\u201d which means \"king\" or \"teeth\". In either case the first syllable is pronounced with a high tone. If the second syllable is pronounced with a low tone, it means \"king\". But if pronounced with a middle tone, it means \"teeth\".\n\nThe use of tonal inflection in Igbo language is very important because it helps to differentiate between words that would otherwise sound the same. It can be challenging for English speakers to learn how to use the tones properly, but with practice, it can be mastered.\n\nConsonants\nIgbo does not have a contrast among voiced occlusives (between voiced stops and nasals): stops precede oral vowels, and nasals precede nasal vowels. Only a limited number of other consonants occur before nasal vowels, including /f, z, s/.\n\nIn some dialects, such as Enu-Onitsha Igbo, the doubly articulated /\u0261\u0361b/ and /k\u0361p/ are realized as a voiced/devoiced labial\u2013velar implosive. The approximant /\u0279/ is realized as an alveolar tap [\u027e] between vowels as in \u00e1r\u00e1. The Enu-Onitsha Igbo dialect is very much similar to Enuani spoken among the Igbo-Anioma people in Delta State.\nTo illustrate the effect of phonological analysis, the following inventory of a typical Central dialect is taken from Clark (1990). Nasality has been analyzed as a feature of consonants, rather than vowels, avoiding the problem of why so few consonants occur before nasal vowels; [CjV] has also been analyzed as /C\u02b2V/.\n\nSyllables are of the form (C)V (optional consonant, vowel) or N (a syllabic nasal). CV is the most common syllable type. Every syllable bears a tone. Consonant clusters do not occur. The semivowels /j/ and /w/ can occur between consonant and vowel in some syllables. The semi-vowel in /CjV/ is analyzed as an underlying vowel \"\u1ecb\", so that -b\u1ecba is the phonemic form of bj\u00e1 'come'. On the other hand, \"w\" in /CwV/ is analyzed as an instance of labialization; so the phonemic form of the verb -gw\u00e1 \"tell\" is /-\u0261\u02b7\u00e1/.\n\nMorphological typology\nIgbo is an isolating language that exhibits very little fusion. The language is predominantly suffixing in a hierarchical manner, such that the ordering of suffixes is governed semantically rather than by fixed position classes. The language has very little inflectional morphology but much derivational and extensional morphology. Most derivation takes place with verbal roots.\nExtensional suffixes, a term used in the Igbo literature, refer to morphology that has some but not all characteristics of derivation. The words created by these suffixes always belong to the same lexical category as the root from which they are created, and the suffixes' effects are principally semantic. On these grounds, Emenanjo (2015) asserts that the suffixes called extensional are bound lexical compounding elements; they cannot occur independently, though many are related to other free morphemes from which they may have originally been derived.\nIn addition to affixation, Igbo exhibits both partial and full reduplication to form gerunds from verbs. The partial form copies on the initial consonant and inserts a high front vowel, while the full form copies the first consonant and vowel. Both types are then prefixed with o-. For example, -go 'buy' partially reduplicates to form \u00f2gigo 'buying,' and -bu 'carry' fully reduplicates to form \u00f2bubu 'carrying'. Some other noun and verb forms also exhibit reduplication, but because the reduplicated forms are semantically unpredictable, reduplication in their case is not synchronically productive, and they are better described as separate lexical items.\n\nGrammatical relations\nIgbo does not mark overt case distinctions on nominal constituents and conveys grammatical relations only through word order. The typical Igbo sentence displays subject-verb-object (SVO) ordering, where the subject is understood as the sole argument of an intransitive verb or the agent-like (external) argument of a transitive verb. Igbo thus exhibits accusative alignment.\nIt has been proposed, with reservations, that some Igbo verbs display ergativity on some level, as in the following two examples:\n\nIn (4), the verb has a single argument, nnukwu mm\u012bri, which appears in subject position, and in the transitive sentence (5), that same argument appears in the object position, even though the two are semantically identical. On this basis, authors such as Emenanjuo (2015) have posited that this argument is an absolutive and that Igbo therefore contains some degree of ergativity.\nHowever, others disagree, arguing that the relevant category is not alignment but underlying argument structure; under this hypothesis, (4) and (5) differ only in the application of a transformation and can be accounted for entirely by the unaccusative hypothesis and the Extended Projection Principle; the nominal argument is generated in object position, and either it is raised to the subject position, as in (4), or the subject position is filled with a pleonastic pronoun, as in (5).\n\nRelative clauses\nIgbo relative clauses are externally headed and follow the head noun. They do not employ overt relative markers or resumptive pronouns, instead leaving a gap in the position of the relativized noun. Subjects and objects can be relativized. Examples include (relative clauses bracketed):\n\nVoice and valence\nIgbo lacks the common valence-decreasing operation of passivization, a fact which has led multiple scholars to claim that \"voice is not a relevant category in Igbo.\" The language does, however, possess some valence-increasing operations that could be construed as voice under a broader definition\n\nIgbo also possess an applicative construction, which takes the suffix -rV, where V copies the previous vowel, and the applicative argument follows the verb directly. The applicative suffix is identical in form with the past tense suffix, with which it should not be confused. For example:\n\nVerb serialization\nIgbo permits verb serialization, which is used extensively to compensate for its paucity of prepositions. Among the meaning types commonly expressed in serial verb constructions are instruments, datives, accompaniment, purpose, and manner. (13) and (14) below illustrate instrumental and dative verb series, respectively:\n\nWriting system\nThe Igbo people invented Nsibidi ideograms, which spread to their neighbors such as Ekoi people, and  Ejegham people for basic written communication. Nsibidi is an ancient system of graphic communication indigenous to peoples in southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon in the Cross River region. It is also used by neighboring Ekoi, Ejegham, Efik, and Ibibio peoples. They have been used since at least the 16th century, under the Aro Confederacy, but died out publicly after they became popular amongst secret societies such as the Ekpe, who used them as a secret form of communication. Nsibidi, however, is not a full writing system, because it cannot transcribe the Igbo language specifically. In 1960, a rural land owner and dibia named Nwagu Aneke developed a syllabary for the Umuleri dialect of Igbo, the script, named after him as the Nwagu Aneke script, was used to write hundreds of diary entries until Aneke's death in 1991. The Nwagu Aneke Project is working on translating Nwagu's commentary and diary.\n\nHistory of Igbo orthography\nBefore the existence of any official system of orthography for the Igbo language, travelers and writers documented Igbo sounds by utilizing the orthracyologies of their own languages in transcribing them, though they encountered difficulty representing particular sounds, such as implosives, labialized velars, syllabic nasals, and non-expanded vowels. In the 1850s, German philologist Karl Richard Lepsius published the Standard Alphabet, which was universal to all languages of the world, and became the first Igbo orthography. It contained 34 letters and included digraphs and diacritical marks to transcribe sounds distinct to African languages. The Lepsius Standard Alphabet contained the following letters:\n\na b d e f g h i k l m n o p r s t u v w y z gb gh gw kp kw \u1e45 nw ny \u1ecd s ds ts\nThe Lepsius orthography was replaced by the Practical Orthography of African Languages (Africa Orthography) in 1929 by the colonial government in Nigeria. The new orthography, created by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (IIALC), had 36 letters and disposed of diacritic marks. Numerous controversial issues with the new orthography eventually led to its replacement in the early 1960s. The Africa Orthography contained the following letters:\n\na b c d e f g gb gh h i j k kp l m n \u014b ny o \u0254 \u0275 p r s t u w y z gw kw nw\n\n\u1eccnw\u1ee5\nThe current \u1eccnw\u1ee5 alphabet, a compromise between the older Lepsius alphabet and a newer alphabet advocated by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (IIALC), is presented in the following table, with the International Phonetic Alphabet equivalents for the characters:\n\nThe graphemes \u27e8gb\u27e9 and \u27e8kp\u27e9 are described both as coarticulated /\u0261\u0361b/ and /k\u0361p/ and as implosives, so both values are included in the table.\n\u27e8m\u27e9 and \u27e8n\u27e9 each represent two phonemes: a nasal consonant and a syllabic nasal.\nTones are sometimes indicated in writing, and sometimes not. When tone is indicated, low tones are shown with a grave accent over the vowel, for example \u27e8a\u27e9 \u2192 \u27e8\u00e0\u27e9, and high tones with an acute accent over the vowel, for example \u27e8a\u27e9 \u2192 \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9.\n\nOther orthographies\nA variety of issues have made agreement on a standardized orthography for the Igbo language difficult. In 1976, the Igbo Standardization Committee criticized the official orthography in light of the difficulty notating diacritic marks using typewriters and computers; difficulty in accurately representing tone with tone-marking conventions, as they are subject to change in different environments; and the inability to capture various sounds particular to certain Igbo dialects. The Committee produced a modified version of the \u1eccnw\u1ee5 orthography, called the New Standard Orthography, which substituted \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9 for \u27e8\u1ecd\u27e9 and \u27e8\u1ee5\u27e9, \u27e8c\u27e9 for \u27e8ch\u27e9, and \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9 for \u27e8\u1e45\u27e9. The New Standard Orthography has not been widely adopted, although it was used, for example, in the 1998 Igbo English Dictionary by Michael Echeruo.\nMore recent calls for reform have been based in part on the rogue use of alphabetic symbols, tonal notations, and spelling conventions that deviate from the standard orthography.\nThere are also some modern movements to restore the use of and modernize nsibidi as a writing system, which mostly focus on Igbo as it is the most populous language that used to use nsibidi.\n\nNdebe Script\nIn 2009, a Nigerian software engineer and artist named Lotanna Igwe-Odunze developed a native script named Ndebe script. It was further redesigned and relaunched in 2020 as a standalone writing system completely independent of Nsibidi. The script gained notable attention after a write-up from Nigerian linguist Kola Tubosun on its \"straightforward\" and \"logical\" approach to indicating tonal and dialectal variety compared to Latin.\n\nProverbs\nProverbs and idiomatic expressions (ilu and akpalaokwu in Igbo, respectively) are highly valued by the Igbo people and proficiency in the language means knowing how to intersperse speech with a good dose of proverbs. Chinua Achebe (in Things Fall Apart) describes proverbs as \"the palm oil with which words are eaten\". Proverbs are widely used in the traditional society to describe, in very few words, what could have otherwise required a thousand words. Proverbs may also become euphemistic means of making certain expressions in the Igbo society, thus the Igbo have come to typically rely on this as avenues of certain expressions.\n\nUsage in the diaspora\nAs a consequence of the Atlantic slave trade, the Igbo language was spread by enslaved Igbo people throughout slave colonies in the Americas. Examples can be found in Jamaican Patois: the pronoun /unu/, used for 'you (plural)', is taken from Igbo, Red eboe refers to a fair-skinned black person because of the reported account of a fair or yellowish skin tone among the Igbo. Soso meaning only comes from Igbo. See List of Jamaican Patois words of African origin for more examples.\nThe word Bim, a name for Barbados, was commonly used by enslaved Barbadians (Bajans). This word is said to derive from the Igbo language, derived from bi mu (or either bem, Ndi bem, Nwanyi ibem or Nwoke ibem) (English: My people), but it may have other origins (see: Barbados etymology).\nIn Cuba, the Igbo language (along with the Efik language) continues to be used, albeit in a creolized form, in ceremonies of the Abaku\u00e1 society, equivalent or derived from the Ekpe society in modern Nigeria.\nIn modern times, Igbo people in the diaspora are putting resources in place to make the study of the language accessible.\n\nPresent state\nThere are some discussions as to whether the Igbo language is in danger of extinction, advanced in part by a 2006 UNESCO report that predicted the Igbo language will become extinct within 50 years. Professor of African and African Diaspora Literatures at University of Massachusetts, Chukwuma Azuonye, emphasizes indicators for the endangerment of the Igbo language based on criteria that includes the declining population of monolingual elderly speakers; reduced competence and performance among Igbo speakers, especially children; the deterioration of idioms, proverbs, and other rhetorical elements of the Igbo language that convey the cultural aesthetic; and code-switching, code-mixing, and language shift.\nExternal and internal factors have been proposed as causes for the decline of the Igbo language and its usage. Preference for the English language in post-colonial Nigeria has usurped the Igbo language's role and function in society, as English is perceived by Igbo speakers as the language of status and opportunity. This perception may be a contributor to the negative attitude towards the Igbo language by its speakers across the spectrum of socio-economic classes. Igbo children's reduced competence and performance has been attributed in part to the lack of exposure in the home environment, which impacts intergenerational transmission of the language. English is the official language in Nigeria and is utilized in government administration, educational institutions, and commerce. Aside from its role in numerous facets of daily life in Nigeria, globalization exerts pressure to utilize English as a universal standard language in support of economic and technological advancement. A 2005 study by Igboanusi and Peter demonstrated the preferential attitude towards English over the Igbo language amongst Igbo people in the communication, entertainment, and media domains. English was preferred by Igbo speakers at 56.5% for oral communication, 91.5% for written communication, 55.5\u201359.5% in entertainment, and 73.5\u201383.5% for media.\nThe effect of English on Igbo languages amongst bilingual Igbo speakers can be seen by the incorporation of English loanwords into Igbo and code-switching between the two languages. English loanwords, which are usually nouns, have been found to retain English semantics, but typically follow phonological and morphological structures of Igbo. Lexical items conform to the vowel harmony intrinsic to Igbo phonological structures. For example, loanwords with syllable-final consonants may be assimilated by the addition of a vowel after the consonant, and vowels are inserted in between consonant clusters, which have not been found to occur in Igbo. This can be seen in the word sukulu, which is a loanword derived from the English word school that has followed the aforementioned pattern of modification when it was assimilated into the Igbo language. Code-switching, which involves the insertion of longer English syntactic units into Igbo utterances, may consist of phrases or entire sentences, principally nouns and verbs, that may or may not follow Igbo syntactic patterns. Igbo affixes to English verbs determine tense and aspectual markers, such as the Igbo suffix -i affixed to the English word 'check', expressed as the word check-i.\nThe standardized Igbo language is composed of fragmented features from numerous Igbo dialects and is not technically a spoken language, but it is used in communicational, educational, and academic contexts. This unification is perceived by Chukwuma Azuonye as undermining the survival of Igbo by erasing diversity between dialects. Each individual dialect possesses unique untranslatable idioms and rhetorical devices that represent Igbo cultural nuances that can be lost as dialects disappear or deteriorate. Newly coined terms may fail to conform to a dialect's lexical formation in assimilating loan words.\nProverbs are an essential component of the Igbo language that convey cultural wisdom and contextual significance to linguistic expression. Everyday usage of Igbo proverbs has declined in recent generations of speakers, which threatens loss in intergenerational transmission. A recent study of the Ogwashi dialect of Igbo demonstrated a steep decline in youth's knowledge and use of proverbs compared to elder speakers. In this study, youths employed simplified or incomplete proverbial expressions, lacked a diverse proverbial repertoire, and were deficient in their understanding of proper contextual usages as compared to elders who demonstrated competence to enhance linguistic expression with a diverse vocabulary of proverbs.\n\nSee also\nDelta Igbo\nIgbo mythology\nIgbo music\nIgbo-Ukwu\nList of Igbo people\nUkwuani\n\nNotes\nReferences\nAwde, Nicholas; Wambu, Onyekachi (1999).

Here is a detailed breakdown of the most useful information:\n\n### Vocabulary and Word Classes\n- **Lexical Categories**: Igbo includes nouns, pronouns, numerals, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, and a single preposition \"na,\" whose meaning is context-dependent.\n- **Adjectives**: Igbo has a limited number of adjectives, typically occurring in pairs of opposites, such as 'ukwu' (big) and 'nta' (small).\n- **Verbs**: Verbs are the most prominent category in Igbo, hosting most of the language's morphology. They are crucial for word formation.\n- **Pronouns**: Igbo pronouns do not index gender, using the same pronouns for male, female, and inanimate beings.\n\n### Phonology\n- **Vowels**: Igbo is a tonal language with vowel harmony, featuring two sets of oral vowels distinguished by pharyngeal cavity size. Nasal vowels are also present.\n- **Tone**: Igbo has high and low tones, which are crucial for meaning. For example, the word \"akwa\" can mean \"cry,\" \"egg,\" \"cloth,\" or \"sew\" depending on the tone.\n- **Consonants**: Igbo does not contrast between voiced stops and nasals. Some dialects have unique realizations of certain consonants, such as the doubly articulated /\u0261\u0361b/ and /k\u0361p/.\n\n### Morphological Typology\n- **Isolating Language**: Igbo exhibits very little fusion and is predominantly suffixing. It has minimal inflectional morphology but extensive derivational and extensional morphology.\n- **Reduplication**: Igbo uses both partial and full reduplication to form gerunds from verbs, which is important for verb conjugation and meaning.\n\n### Grammatical Relations\n- **Word Order**: Igbo typically follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) order, conveying grammatical relations through word order rather than case markings.\n- **Relative Clauses**: These are externally headed and follow the head noun without overt relative markers or resumptive pronouns.\n\n### Voice and Valence\n- **Lack of Passivization**: Igbo does not have a passive voice but includes valence-increasing operations like the applicative construction.\n\n### Verb Serialization\n- **Compensation for Prepositions**: Igbo uses verb serialization extensively to express meanings typically conveyed by prepositions in other languages.\n\n### Writing System\n- **Orthography**: The current \u1eccnw\u1ee5 alphabet is a compromise between older systems and includes specific characters for Igbo sounds. Tones are sometimes indicated with diacritics.\n- **Nsibidi and Ndebe Scripts**: While not full writing systems for Igbo, these scripts are part of the cultural heritage and may be relevant for historical or cultural translations.\n\n### Proverbs\n- **Cultural Significance**: Proverbs are an essential part of Igbo language and culture, often used to convey wisdom and enhance speech.\n\n### Usage in the Diaspora\n- **Influence on Other Languages**: Igbo has influenced languages in the diaspora, such as Jamaican Patois and Cuban creoles, which may be relevant for translations involving cultural or historical contexts.\n\n### Present State and Challenges\n- **Language Endangerment**: Awareness of the language's endangered status and the influence of English is important for understanding contemporary usage and potential shifts in meaning.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, a translator can effectively navigate the complexities of the Igbo language, ensuring accurate and culturally sensitive translations.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:01:08.815995"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language": {"base_content": "Aramaic (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic: \u05d0\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05ea, romanized: \u02c0\u0259r\u0101mi\u1e6f Imperial Aramaic pronunciation: [\u0294\u025br\u0251mit\u02e4]; Classical Syriac: \u0710\u072a\u0721\u0710\u071d\u072c, romanized: ar\u0101m\u0101\u02c0i\u1e6f) is a Northwest Semitic language that originated in the ancient region of Syria and quickly spread to Mesopotamia, the southern Levant, southeastern Anatolia, Eastern Arabia and the Sinai Peninsula, where it has been continually written and spoken in different varieties for over three thousand years.\nAramaic served as a language of public life and administration of ancient kingdoms and empires, particularly the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Neo-Babylonian Empire and Achaemenid Empire, and also as a language of divine worship and religious study within Judaism, Christianity and Gnosticism. Several modern varieties of Aramaic are still spoken. The modern eastern branch is spoken by Assyrians, Mandeans and  Mizrahi Jews. Western Aramaic is still spoken by the Muslim and Christian Arameans (Syriacs) in the towns of Maaloula and nearby Jubb'adin in Syria. Classical varieties are used as liturgical and literary languages in several West Asian churches, as well as in Judaism, Samaritanism, and Mandaeism.\nAramaic belongs to the Northwest group of the Semitic language family, which also includes the mutually intelligible Canaanite languages such as Hebrew, Edomite, Moabite, Ekronite, Sutean, and Phoenician, as well as Amorite and Ugaritic. Aramaic languages are written in the Aramaic alphabet, a descendant of the Phoenician alphabet, and the most prominent alphabet variant is the Syriac alphabet founded in Assyria. The Aramaic alphabet also became a base for the creation and adaptation of specific writing systems in some other Semitic languages of West Asia, such as the Hebrew alphabet and the Arabic alphabet.\nThe Aramaic languages are now considered endangered, with several varieties used mainly by the older generations. Researchers are working to record and analyze all of the remaining varieties of Neo-Aramaic languages before or in case they become extinct. Aramaic dialects today form the mother tongues of the Arameans (Syriacs) in the Qalamoun mountains, Assyrians of Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran and Mandaeans, as well as some Mizrahi Jews.\nEarly Aramaic inscriptions date from 11th century BC, placing it among the earliest languages to be written down. Aramaicist Holger Gzella notes, \"The linguistic history of Aramaic prior to the appearance of the first textual sources in the ninth century BC remains unknown.\" Aramaic is also believed by most historians and scholars to have been the primary language spoken by Jesus of Nazareth both for preaching and in everyday life.\n\nHistory\nHistorically and originally, Aramaic was the language of the Arameans, a Semitic-speaking people of the region between the northern Levant and the northern Tigris valley. By around 1000 BC, the Arameans had a string of kingdoms in what is now part of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and the fringes of southern Mesopotamia (Iraq). Aramaic rose to prominence under the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013605 BC), under whose influence Aramaic became a prestige language after being adopted as a lingua franca of the empire by Assyrian kings, and its use was spread throughout Mesopotamia, the Levant and parts of Asia Minor, Arabian Peninsula, and Ancient Iran under Assyrian rule. At its height, Aramaic was spoken in what is now Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, parts of southeast and south central Turkey, northern parts of the Arabian Peninsula and parts of northwest Iran, as well as the southern Caucasus, having gradually replaced several other related Semitic languages.\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 38b), the language spoken by Adam \u2013 the Bible's first human \u2013 was Aramaic.\nAramaic was the language of Jesus, who spoke the Galilean dialect during his public ministry, as well as the language of several sections of the Hebrew Bible, including parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra, and also the language of the Targum, the Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Bible. It is also the language of the Jerusalem Talmud, Babylonian Talmud, and Zohar.\nThe scribes of the Neo-Assyrian bureaucracy also used Aramaic, and this practice was subsequently inherited by the succeeding Neo-Babylonian Empire (605\u2013539 BC) and later by the Achaemenid Empire (539\u2013330 BC). Mediated by scribes that had been trained in the language, highly standardized written Aramaic, named by scholars Imperial Aramaic, progressively also became the lingua franca of public life, trade and commerce throughout Achaemenid territories. Wide use of written Aramaic subsequently led to the adoption of the Aramaic alphabet and, as logograms, some Aramaic vocabulary in the Pahlavi scripts, which were used by several Middle Iranian languages, including Parthian, Middle Persian, Sogdian, and Khwarezmian.\nSome variants of Aramaic are also retained as sacred languages by certain religious communities. Most notable among them is Classical Syriac, the liturgical language of Syriac Christianity. It is used by several communities, including the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Maronite Church, and also the Saint Thomas Christians, Syriac Christians of Kerala, India. One of the liturgical dialects was Mandaic, which besides becoming a vernacular, Neo-Mandaic, also remained the liturgical language of Mandaeism. Syriac was also the liturgical language of several now-extinct gnostic faiths, such as Manichaeism.\nNeo-Aramaic languages are still spoken in the 21st century as a first language by many communities of Assyrians, Mizrahi Jews (in particular, the Jews of Kurdistan/Iraqi Jews), and Mandaeans of the Near East, with the main Neo-Aramaic languages being Suret (~240,000 speakers) and Turoyo (~250,000 speakers). Western Neo-Aramaic (~3,000) persists in only two villages in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains in western Syria. They have retained use of the once-dominant lingua franca despite subsequent language shifts experienced throughout the Middle East.\n\nName\nThe connection between Chaldean, Syriac, and Samaritan as \"Aramaic\" was first identified in 1679 by German theologian Johann Wilhelm Hilliger. In 1819\u201321 Ulrich Friedrich Kopp published his Bilder und Schriften der Vorzeit (\"Images and Inscriptions of the Past\"), in which he established the basis of the paleographical development of the Northwest Semitic scripts. Kopp criticised Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy and other scholars who had characterized all the then-known inscriptions and coins as Phoenician, with \"everything left to the Phoenicians and nothing to the Arameans, as if they could not have written at all\". Kopp noted that some of the words on the Carpentras Stele corresponded to the Aramaic in the Book of Daniel, and in the Book of Ruth.\nJosephus and Strabo (the latter citing Posidonius) both stated that the \"Syrians\" called themselves \"Arameans\". The Septuagint, the earliest extant full copy of the Hebrew Bible, a Greek translation, used the terms Syria and Syrian where the Masoretic Text, the earliest extant Hebrew copy of the Bible, uses the terms Aramean and Aramaic; numerous later bibles followed the Septuagint's usage, including the King James Version. This connection between the names Syrian and Aramaic was discussed in 1835 by \u00c9tienne Marc Quatrem\u00e8re.\nIn historical sources, Aramaic language is designated by two distinctive groups of terms, first of them represented by endonymic (native) names, and the other one represented by various exonymic (foreign in origin) names. Native (endonymic) terms for Aramaic language were derived from the same word root as the name of its original speakers, the ancient Arameans. Endonymic forms were also adopted in some other languages, like ancient Hebrew. In the Torah (Hebrew Bible), \"Aram\" is used as a proper name of several people including descendants of Shem, Nahor, and Jacob. Ancient Aram, bordering northern Israel and what is now called Syria, is considered the linguistic center of Aramaic, the language of the Arameans who settled the area during the Bronze Age c.\u20093500 BC. The language is often mistakenly considered to have originated within Assyria (Iraq). In fact, Arameans carried their language and writing into Mesopotamia by voluntary migration, by forced exile of conquering armies, and by nomadic Chaldean invasions of Babylonia during the period from 1200 to 1000 BC.\nUnlike in Hebrew, designations for Aramaic language in some other ancient languages were mostly exonymic. In ancient Greek, Aramaic language was most commonly known as the \"Syrian language\", in relation to the native (non-Greek) inhabitants of the historical region of Syria. Since the name of Syria itself emerged as a variant of Assyria, the biblical Ashur, and Akkadian Ashuru, a complex set of semantic phenomena was created, becoming a subject of interest both among ancient writers and modern scholars.\nThe Koine Greek word \u1f19\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ca\u03c3\u03c4\u03af (Hebra\u00efst\u00ed) has been translated as \"Aramaic\" in some versions of the Christian New Testament, as Aramaic was at that time the language commonly spoken by the Jews. However, \u1f19\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ca\u03c3\u03c4\u03af is consistently used in Koine Greek at this time to mean Hebrew and \u03a3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af (Syristi) is used to mean Aramaic. In Biblical scholarship, the term \"Chaldean\" was for many years used as a synonym of Aramaic, due to its use in the book of Daniel and subsequent interpretation by Jerome.\n\nGeographic distribution\nDuring the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires, Arameans, the native speakers of Aramaic, began to settle in greater numbers in Babylonia, and later in the heartland of Assyria, also known as the \"Arbela triangle\" (Assur, Nineveh, and Arbela). The influx eventually resulted in the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013605 BC) adopting an Akkadian-influenced Imperial Aramaic as the lingua franca of its empire. This policy was continued by the short-lived Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Medes, and all three empires became operationally bilingual in written sources, with Aramaic used alongside Akkadian. The Achaemenid Empire (539\u2013323 BC) continued this tradition, and the extensive influence of these empires led to Aramaic gradually becoming the lingua franca of most of western Asia,  Anatolia, the Caucasus, and Egypt.\nBeginning with the rise of the Rashidun Caliphate and the early Muslim conquests in the late seventh century, Arabic gradually replaced Aramaic as the lingua franca of the Near East. However, Aramaic remains a spoken, literary, and liturgical language for local Christians and also some Jews. Aramaic also continues to be spoken by the Assyrians of northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and northwest Iran, with diaspora communities in Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and southern Russia. The Mandaeans also continue to use Classical Mandaic as a liturgical language, although most now speak Arabic as their first language. There are still also a small number of first-language speakers of Western Aramaic varieties in isolated villages in western Syria.\nBeing in contact with other regional languages, some Neo-Aramaic dialects were often engaged in the mutual exchange of influences, particularly with Arabic, Iranian, and Kurdish.\nThe turbulence of the last two centuries (particularly the Assyrian genocide, also known as Seyfo \"Sword\" in Syriac, has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world. However, there are several sizable Assyrian towns in northern Iraq, such as Alqosh, Bakhdida, Bartella, Tesqopa, and Tel Keppe, and numerous small villages, where Aramaic is still the main spoken language, and many large cities in this region also have Suret-speaking communities, particularly Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, Dohuk, and al-Hasakah. In modern Israel, the only native Aramaic-speaking population are the Jews of Kurdistan, although the language is dying out. However, Aramaic is also experiencing a revival among Maronites in Israel in Jish.\n\nAramaic languages and dialects\nAramaic is often spoken of as a single language but is actually a group of related languages. Some languages differ more from each other than the Romance languages do among themselves. Its long history, extensive literature, and use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not, similar to the situation with modern varieties of Arabic.\nSome Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, Syriac is particularly used to describe the Eastern Aramaic variety spoken by Syriac Christian communities in northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, and northwestern Iran, and the Saint Thomas Christians in Kerala, India. Most dialects can be described as either \"Eastern\" or \"Western\", the dividing line being roughly the Euphrates, or slightly west of it.\nIt is also helpful to distinguish modern living languages, or Neo-Aramaics, and those that are still in use as literary or liturgical languages or are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives \"Old\", \"Middle\", and \"Modern\" periods alongside \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" areas to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.\n\nWriting system\nThe earliest Aramaic alphabet was based on the Phoenician alphabet. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive \"square\" style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of Canaan adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the Hebrew alphabet. This is the writing system used in Biblical Aramaic and other Jewish writing in Aramaic. The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the Syriac alphabet. A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the Mandaic alphabet, is used by the Mandaeans.\nIn addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: the Nabataean alphabet in Petra and the Palmyrene alphabet in Palmyra. In modern times, Turoyo (see below) has sometimes been written in a Latin script.\n\nPeriodization\nPeriodization of historical development of Aramaic language has been the subject of particular interest for scholars, who proposed several types of periodization, based on linguistic, chronological and territorial criteria. Overlapping terminology, used in different periodizations, led to the creation of several polysemic terms, that are used differently among scholars. Terms like: Old Aramaic, Ancient Aramaic, Early Aramaic, Middle Aramaic, Late Aramaic (and some others, like Paleo-Aramaic), were used in various meanings, thus referring (in scope or substance) to different stages in historical development of Aramaic language.\nMost commonly used types of periodization are those of Klaus Beyer and Joseph Fitzmyer.\nPeriodization of Klaus Beyer (1929\u20132014):\n\nOld Aramaic, from the earliest records, to c. 200 AD\nMiddle Aramaic, from c. 200 AD, to c. 1200 AD\nModern Aramaic, from c. 1200 AD, up to the modern times\nPeriodization of Joseph Fitzmyer (1920\u20132016):\n\nOld Aramaic, from the earliest records, to regional prominence c. 700 BC\nOfficial Aramaic, from c. 700 BC, to c. 200 BC\nMiddle Aramaic, from c. 200 BC, to c. 200 AD\nLate Aramaic, from c. 200 AD, to c. 700 AD\nModern Aramaic, from c. 700 AD, up to the modern times\nRecent periodization of Aaron Butts:\n\nOld Aramaic, from the earliest records, to c. 538 BC\nAchaemenid Aramaic, from c. 538 BC, to c. 333 BC\nMiddle Aramaic, from c. 333 BC, to c. 200 AD\nLate Aramaic, from c. 200 AD, to c. 1200 AD\nNeo-Aramaic, from c. 1200 AD, up to the modern times\n\nOld Aramaic\nAramaic's long history and diverse and widespread use has led to the development of many divergent varieties, which are sometimes considered dialects, though they have become distinct enough over time that they are now sometimes considered separate languages. Therefore, there is not one singular, static Aramaic language; each time and place rather has had its own variation. The more widely spoken Eastern Aramaic languages are largely restricted to Assyrian, Mandean and Mizrahi Jewish communities in Iraq, northeastern Syria, northwestern Iran, and southeastern Turkey, whilst the severely endangered Western Neo-Aramaic language is spoken by small Christian and Muslim communities in the Anti-Lebanon mountains, and closely related western varieties of Aramaic persisted in Mount Lebanon until as late as the 17th century.\nThe term \"Old Aramaic\" is used to describe the varieties of the language from its first known use, until the point roughly marked by the rise of the Sasanian Empire (224 AD), dominating the influential, eastern dialect region. As such, the term covers over thirteen centuries of the development of Aramaic. This vast time span includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct. Regarding the earliest forms, Beyer suggests that written Aramaic probably dates from the 11th century BCE, as it is established by the 10th century, to which he dates the oldest inscriptions of northern Syria. Heinrichs uses the less controversial date of the 9th century, for which there is clear and widespread attestation.\nThe central phase in the development of Old Aramaic was its official use by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013608 BC), Neo-Babylonian Empire (620\u2013539 BC), and Achaemenid Empire (500\u2013330 BC). The period before this, dubbed \"Ancient Aramaic\", saw the development of the language from being spoken in Aramaean city-states to become a major means of communication in diplomacy and trade throughout Mesopotamia, the Levant, and Egypt. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic dialect continuum and the development of differing written standards.\n\nAncient Aramaic\n\"Ancient Aramaic\" refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the lingua franca of the Fertile Crescent. It was the language of the Aramean city-states of Damascus, Hamath, and Arpad.\nThere are inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the 10th century BC. These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The alphabet of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on the Phoenician alphabet, and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined alphabet, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Due to increasing Aramean migration eastward, the Western periphery of Assyria became bilingual in Akkadian and Aramean at least as early as the mid-9th century BC. As the Neo-Assyrian Empire conquered Aramean lands west of the Euphrates, Tiglath-Pileser III made Aramaic the Empire's second official language, and it eventually supplanted Akkadian completely.\nFrom 700 BC, the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its unity. Different dialects emerged in Assyria, Babylonia, the Levant and Egypt. Around 600 BC, Adon, a Canaanite king, used Aramaic to write to an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n\nImperial Aramaic\nAround 500 BC, following the Achaemenid (Persian) conquest of Mesopotamia under Darius I, Aramaic (as had been used in that region) was adopted by the conquerors as the \"vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did\". In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an \"official language\", noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language. Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the lingua franca of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought.\nImperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of Persian gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 330 BC), Imperial Aramaic \u2013 or a version thereof near enough for it to be recognisable \u2013 would remain an influence on the various native Iranian languages. Aramaic script and \u2013 as ideograms \u2013 Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the Pahlavi scripts.\nOne of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the Persepolis Administrative Archives, found at Persepolis, which number about five hundred. Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from Egypt, and Elephantine in particular (see Elephantine papyri). Of them, the best known is the Story of Ahikar, a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical Book of Proverbs. Consensus as of 2022 regards the Aramaic portion of the Biblical book of Daniel (i.e., 2:4b\u20137:28) as an example of Imperial (Official) Aramaic.\nAchaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.\nA group of thirty Aramaic documents from Bactria have been discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BC Achaemenid administration of Bactria and Sogdia.\n\nBiblical Aramaic\nBiblical Aramaic is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the Old Testament:\n\nEzra \u2013 documents from the Achaemenid period (5th century BC) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.\nDaniel \u2013 five tales and an apocalyptic vision.\nJeremiah 10:11 \u2013 a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.\nGenesis \u2013 translation of a Hebrew place-name.\nBiblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. It is theorized that some Biblical Aramaic material originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty.\nBiblical Aramaic presented various challenges for writers who were engaged in early Biblical studies. Since the time of Jerome of Stridon (d. 420), Aramaic of the Bible was named as \"Chaldean\" (Chaldaic, Chaldee). That label remained common in early Aramaic studies, and persisted up into the nineteenth century. The \"Chaldean misnomer\" was eventually abandoned, when modern scholarly analyses showed that Aramaic dialect used in the Hebrew Bible was not related to ancient Chaldeans and their language.\n\nPost-Achaemenid Aramaic\nThe fall of the Achaemenid Empire (c. 334\u2013330 BC), and its replacement with the newly created political order, imposed by Alexander the Great (d. 323 BC) and his Hellenistic successors, marked an important turning point in the history of Aramaic language. During the early stages of the post-Achaemenid era, public use of Aramaic language was continued, but shared with the newly introduced Greek language. By the year 300 BC, all of the main Aramaic-speaking regions came under political rule of the newly created Seleucid Empire that promoted Hellenistic culture, and favored Greek language as the main language of public life and administration. During the 3rd century BCE, Greek overtook Aramaic in many spheres of public communication, particularly in highly Hellenized cities throughout the Seleucid domains. However, Aramaic continued to be used, in its post-Achaemenid form, among upper and literate classes of native Aramaic-speaking communities, and also by local authorities (along with the newly introduced Greek). Post-Achaemenid Aramaic, that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the Achaemenid period, continued to be used up to the 2nd century BCE.\nBy the end of the 2nd century BC, several variants of Post-Achaemenid Aramaic emerged, bearing regional characteristics. One of them was Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official administrative language of Hasmonaean Judaea (142\u201337 BC), alongside Hebrew, which was the language preferred in religious and some other public uses (coinage). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the Qumran texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major Targums, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean Aramaic. It also appears in quotations in the Mishnah and Tosefta, although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.\nThe use of written Aramaic in the Achaemenid bureaucracy also precipitated the adoption of Aramaic(-derived) scripts to render a number of Middle Iranian languages. Moreover, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, continued to be written as Aramaic \"words\" even when writing Middle Iranian languages. In time, in Iranian usage, these Aramaic \"words\" became disassociated from the Aramaic language and came to be understood as signs (i.e. logograms), much like the symbol '&' is read as \"and\" in English and the original Latin et is now no longer obvious. Under the early 3rd-century BC Parthian Arsacids, whose government used Greek but whose native language was Parthian, the Parthian language and its Aramaic-derived writing system both gained prestige. This in turn also led to the adoption of the name 'pahlavi' (< parthawi, \"of the Parthians\") for that writing system. The Persian Sassanids, who succeeded the Parthian Arsacids in the mid-3rd century AD, subsequently inherited/adopted the Parthian-mediated Aramaic-derived writing system for their own Middle Iranian ethnolect as well. That particular Middle Iranian dialect, Middle Persian, i.e. the language of Persia proper, subsequently also became a prestige language. Following the conquest of the Sassanids by the Arabs in the 7th-century, the Aramaic-derived writing system was replaced by the Arabic alphabet in all but Zoroastrian usage, which continued to use the name 'pahlavi' for the Aramaic-derived writing system and went on to create the bulk of all Middle Iranian literature in that writing system.\nOther regional dialects continued to exist alongside these, often as simple, spoken variants of Aramaic. Early evidence for these vernacular dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, some of those regional dialects became written languages by the 2nd century BC. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not directly dependent on Achaemenid Aramaic, and they also show a clear linguistic diversity between eastern and western regions.\n\nTargumic\nBabylonian Targumic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the Targum Onqelos and Targum Jonathan, the \"official\" targums. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.\nGalilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of Galilee. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century AD, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century AD onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.\n\nBabylonian Documentary Aramaic\nBabylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century AD onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.\n\nNabataean\nNabataean Aramaic was the written language of the Arab kingdom of Nabataea, whose capital was Petra. The kingdom (c. 200 BC \u2013 106 AD) controlled the region to the east of the Jordan River, the Negev, the Sinai Peninsula, and the northern Hijaz, and supported a wide-ranging trade network. The Nabataeans used imperial Aramaic for written communications, rather than their native Arabic. Nabataean Aramaic developed from Imperial Aramaic, with some influence from Arabic: \"l\" is often turned into \"n\", and there are some Arabic loanwords. Arabic influence on Nabataean Aramaic increased over time. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions date from the early days of the kingdom, but most datable inscriptions are from the first four centuries AD. The language is written in a cursive script that was the precursor to the Arabic alphabet. After annexation by the Romans in 106 AD, most of Nabataea was subsumed into the province of Arabia Petraea, the Nabataeans turned to Greek for written communications, and the use of Aramaic declined.\n\nPalmyrene\nPalmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the multicultural city state of Palmyra in the Syrian Desert from 44 BC to 274 AD. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive Estrangela. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree.\n\nEastern dialects\nIn the eastern regions (from Mesopotamia to Persia), dialects like Palmyrene Aramaic and Arsacid Aramaic gradually merged with the regional vernacular dialects, thus creating languages with a foot in Achaemenid and a foot in regional Aramaic.\nIn the Kingdom of Osroene, founded in 132 BCE and centred in Edessa (Urhay), the regional dialect became the official language: Edessan Aramaic (Urhaya), that later came to be known as Classical Syriac. On the upper reaches of the Tigris, East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from the regions of Hatra and Assur.\nTatian the Assyrian (or Syrian), the author of the gospel harmony the Diatessaron came from Adiabene (Syr. Beth-Hadiab), and perhaps wrote his work (172 AD) in East Mesopotamian rather than Classical Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from c.\u200970 AD). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.\nThe written form of Mandaic, the language of Mandaeism, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.\n\nWestern dialects\nThe western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing Phoenician in the first century BC and Hebrew around the turn of the fourth century AD.\nThe form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of Caesarea Philippi. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of the Book of Enoch (c. 170 BC). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean lasting into the second century AD. Old Judean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the Talmud and receipts from Qumran. Josephus' first, non-extant edition of his The Jewish War was written in Old Judean.\nThe Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century AD by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see Peshitta).\n\nLanguages during Jesus' lifetime\nIt is generally believed by Christian scholars that in the first century, Jews in Judea primarily spoke Aramaic with a decreasing number using Hebrew as their first language, though many learned Hebrew as a liturgical language. Additionally, Koine Greek was the lingua franca of the Near East in trade, among the Hellenized classes (much like French in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries in Europe), and in the Roman administration. Latin, the language of the Roman army and higher levels of administration, had almost no impact on the linguistic landscape.\nIn addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on Hasmonean and Babylonian, there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects spoken in the southern Levant. Seven Western Aramaic varieties were spoken in the vicinity of Judea in Jesus' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judean was the prominent dialect of Jerusalem and Judaea. The region of Ein Gedi spoke the Southeast Judaean dialect. Samaritan Aramaic was distinct; it ultimately merged [\u0294], [h], [\u0127], and [\u0295] as a glottal stop, only maintaining [\u0295] in the initial position before the vowel [a]. Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature, and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features, including the collapse of gutturals and the maintenance of diphthongs. In the Transjordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian Aramaic were spoken. In the region of Damascus and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as Aleppo, the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.\nThe three languages, especially Hebrew and Aramaic, influenced one another through loanwords and semantic loans. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic. Most were mostly technical religious words, but a few were everyday words like \u05e2\u05e5 \u02bf\u0113\u1e63 \"wood\". Conversely, Aramaic words, such as m\u0101mm\u00f4n \"wealth\" were borrowed into Hebrew, and Hebrew words acquired additional senses from Aramaic. For instance, Hebrew: \u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9, romanized: r\u0101\u02be\u00fbi, lit.\u2009'seen' borrowed the sense \"worthy, seemly\" from Aramaic \u1e25z\u00ee \"seen, worthy\".\nNew Testament Greek preserves some semiticisms, including transliterations of Semitic words. Some are Aramaic, like talitha (\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1), which represents the Aramaic noun \u05d8\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea\u05d0 \u1e6dal\u012b\u1e6f\u0101, and others may be either Hebrew or Aramaic like \u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 Rabbounei (\u03a1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9), which means \"my master/great one/teacher\" in both languages. Other examples:\n\n\"Talitha kumi\" (\u05d8\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea\u05d0 \u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d9)\n\"Ephphatha\" (\u05d0\u05ea\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7)\n\"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\" (?\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9, \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9, \u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05e7\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9)\nThe 2004 film The Passion of the Christ used Aramaic for much of its dialogue, specially reconstructed by a scholar, William Fulco, S.J. Where the appropriate words (in first-century Aramaic) were no longer known, he used the Aramaic of Daniel and fourth-century Syriac and Hebrew as the basis for his work.\n\nMiddle Aramaic\nDuring the Late Middle Aramaic period, spanning from 300 B.C.E. to 200 C.E., Aramaic diverged into its eastern and western branches. During this time, the nature of various Aramaic dialects began to change. The descendants of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional dialects started to develop significant new literatures. Unlike many dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.\n\nEastern Middle Aramaic\nThe dialects of Old Eastern Aramaic continued in ancient Assyria, Babylon, and the Achaemenid Empire as written languages using various Aramaic scripts. Eastern Middle Aramaic comprises Classical Mandaic, Hatran, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic dialects, and Classical Syriac\n\nSyriac Aramaic\nSyriac Aramaic (also \"Classical Syriac\") is the literary, liturgical, and often spoken language of Syriac Christianity. It originated in the first century in the region of Osroene, centered in Edessa, but its golden age was the fourth to eighth centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the Peshitta, and the masterful prose and poetry of Ephrem the Syrian. Classical Syriac became the language of Eastern Christianity and missionary activity led to the spread of Syriac from Mesopotamia and Persia, into Central Asia, India, and China.\n\nJewish Babylonian Aramaic\nJewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the fourth and the eleventh century. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian Talmud (which was completed in the seventh century) and of post-Talmudic Geonic literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Judaism. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of incantation bowls written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic.\n\nMandaic Aramaic\nClassical Mandaic, used as a liturgical language by the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran, is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. It is the language in which the Mandaeans' gnostic religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography and does not make use of vowel diacritics.\n\nWestern Middle Aramaic\nThe dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Nabataean, Jewish Palestinian (in Hebrew \"square script\"), Samaritan Aramaic (in the Old Hebrew script), and Christian Palestinian (in Syriac Estrangela script). Of these four, only Jewish Palestinian continued as a written language.\n\nSamaritan Aramaic\nThe Samaritan Aramaic is earliest attested by the documentary tradition of the Samaritans that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.\n\nJewish Palestinian Aramaic\nIn 135, after the Bar Kokhba revolt, many Jewish leaders, expelled from Jerusalem, moved to Galilee. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the Jerusalem Talmud (completed in the 5th century), Palestinian targumim (Jewish Aramaic versions of scripture), and midrashim (biblical commentaries and teaching). The standard vowel pointing for the Hebrew Bible, the Tiberian system (7th century), was developed by speakers of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. Classical Hebrew vocalisation, therefore, in representing the Hebrew of this period, probably reflects the contemporary pronunciation of this Aramaic dialect.\nMiddle Judaean Aramaic, the descendant of Old Judaean Aramaic, was no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, Middle East Jordanian Aramaic continued as a minor dialect from Old East Jordanian Aramaic. The inscriptions in the synagogue at Dura-Europos are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.\n\nChristian Palestinian Aramaic\nThis was the language of the Christian Melkite (Chalcedonian) community, predominantly of Jewish descent, in Palestine, Transjordan and Sinai from the 5th to the 8th century. As a liturgical language, it was used up to the 13th century. It is also been called \"Melkite Aramaic\", \"Syro-Palestinian\" and \"Palestinian Syriac\". The language itself comes from Old Western Aramaic, but its writing conventions were based on the Aramaic dialect of Edessa, and it was heavily influenced by Greek. For example, the name Jesus, Syriac \u012b\u0161\u016b\u2018, is written \u012bs\u016bs, a transliteration of the Greek form, in Christian Palestinian.\n\nModern Aramaic\nAs the Western Aramaic dialects of the Levant have become nearly extinct in non-liturgical usage, the most prolific speakers of Neo-Aramaic languages in the 21st century are Eastern Aramaic speakers, the most numerous being the Central Neo-Aramaic and Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) speakers of Mesopotamia. This includes speakers of the Assyrian (235,000 speakers) and Chaldean (216,000 speakers) varieties of Suret, and Turoyo (112,000 to 450,000 speakers). Having largely lived in remote areas as insulated communities for over a millennium, the remaining speakers of modern Aramaic dialects, such as the Arameans of the Qalamoun Mountains, Assyrians, Mandaeans and Mizrahi Jews, escaped the linguistic pressures experienced by others during the large-scale language shifts that saw the proliferation of other tongues among those who previously did not speak them, most recently the Arabization of the Middle East and North Africa by Arabs beginning with the early Muslim conquests of the seventh century.\n\nModern Eastern Aramaic\nModern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by Assyrians, Mizrahi Jews, and Mandaeans, with mutually unintelligible variations within each of these groups.\nThe Christian varieties of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) are often called \"Assyrian\", \"Chaldean\" or \"Eastern Syriac\", and are spoken by the Assyrians in northern Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran, and in the diaspora. However, they also have roots in numerous previously unwritten local Aramaic varieties and, in some cases, even contain Akkadian influences. These varieties are not purely the direct descendants of the language of Ephrem the Syrian, which was Classical Syriac.\nThe Judeo-Aramaic languages are now mostly spoken in Israel, and most are facing extinction. The Jewish varieties that have come from communities that once lived between Lake Urmia and Mosul are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example Urmia, Christian Assyrians and Mizrahi Jews speak mutually unintelligible varieties of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic in the same place. In others, the Nineveh Plains around Mosul for example, the varieties of these two ethnicities are similar enough to allow conversation.\nModern Central Neo-Aramaic, being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, is generally represented by Turoyo, the language of the Assyrians/Syriacs of Tur Abdin. A related Neo-Aramaic language, Mla\u1e25s\u00f4, has recently become extinct.\nMandaeans living in the Khuzestan province of Iran and scattered throughout Iraq, speak Neo-Mandaic. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic variety. Mandaeans number some 50,000\u201375,000 people, but it is believed Neo-Mandaic may now be spoken fluently by as few as 5,000 people, with other Mandaeans having varying degrees of knowledge.\n\nModern Western Aramaic\nVery little remains of Western Aramaic. Its only remaining vernacular is Western Neo-Aramaic, which is still spoken in the Aramean villages of Maaloula and Jubb'adin on Syria's side of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, as well as by some people who migrated from these villages, to Damascus and other larger towns of Syria. Bakh'a was completely destroyed during the Syrian civil war and all the survivors fled to other parts of Syria or to Lebanon. All these speakers of modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic as well. Other Western Aramaic languages, like Jewish Palestinian Aramaic and Samaritan Aramaic, are preserved only in liturgical and literary usage.\n\nSample texts\nMatthew 2, verses 1\u20134, in Classical Syriac (Eastern accent), Christian Palestinian Aramaic and Suret (Swadaya):\n\nMatthew 28, verse 16, in Classical Syriac (Eastern accent), Western Neo-Aramaic, Turoyo and Suret (Swadaya):\n\nPhonology\nEach dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be feasible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. Some modern Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of \"emphatic\" consonants, and some have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly Arabic, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, Persian, and Turkish.\n\nVowels\nAs with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:\n\nOpen a-vowels\nClose front i-vowels\nClose back u-vowels\nThese vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.\nThe open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel (\"short\" a, somewhat like the first vowel in the English \"batter\", [a]). It usually has a back counterpart (\"long\" a, like the a in \"father\", [\u0251], or even tending to the vowel in \"caught\", [\u0254]), and a front counterpart (\"short\" e, like the vowel in \"head\", [\u025b]). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects. There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short a and short e. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long a became the o sound. The open e and back a are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters \u05d0 \"alaph\" (a glottal stop) or \u05d4 \"he\" (like the English h).\nThe close front vowel is the \"long\" i (like the vowel in \"need\", [i]). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the \"long\" e, as in the final vowel of \"caf\u00e9\" ([e]). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close e corresponds with the open e in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant \u05d9 y as a mater lectionis.\nThe close back vowel is the \"long\" u (like the vowel in \"school\", [u]). It has a more open counterpart, the \"long\" o, like the vowel in \"show\" ([o]). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close o sometimes corresponding with the long open a. The close back vowels often use the consonant \u05d5 w to indicate their quality.\nTwo basic diphthongs exist: an open vowel followed by \u05d9 y (ay), and an open vowel followed by \u05d5 w (aw). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to e and o respectively.\nThe so-called \"emphatic\" consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.\n\nConsonants\nThe various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a stop and a fricative at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:\n\nLabial set: \u05e4\u05bc\\\u05e4 p/f and \u05d1\u05bc\\\u05d1 b/v,\nDental set: \u05ea\u05bc\\\u05ea t/\u03b8 and \u05d3\u05bc\\\u05d3 d/\u00f0,\nVelar set: \u05db\u05bc\\\u05db k/x and \u05d2\u05bc\\\u05d2 \u0261/\u0263.\nEach member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, p and f are written with the same letter), and are near allophones.\nA distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of \"emphatic\" consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of pharyngealization and velarization. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:\n\n\u05d7 \u1e24\u00ea\u1e6f, a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, /\u0127/,\n\u05d8 \u1e6c\u00ea\u1e6f, a pharyngealized t, /t\u02e4/,\n\u05e2 \u02bdAyin (or \u02bdE in some dialects), a pharyngealized glottal stop (sometimes considered to be a voiced pharyngeal approximant), [\u0295] or [\u0294\u02e4],\n\u05e6 \u1e62\u0101\u1e0f\u00ea, a pharyngealized s, /s\u02e4/,\n\u05e7 Q\u00f4p, a voiceless uvular stop, /q/.\n\nAncient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics, and some Neo-Aramaic languages definitely do. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.\nOverlapping with the set of emphatics are the \"guttural\" consonants. They include \u05d7 \u1e24\u00ea\u1e6f and \u05e2 \u02bdAyn from the emphatic set, and add \u05d0 \u02bc\u0100lap\u0304 (a glottal stop) and \u05d4 H\u00ea (as the English \"h\").\nAramaic classically has a set of four sibilants (ancient Aramaic may have had six):\n\n\u05e1, \u05e9\u05c2 /s/ (as in English \"sea\"),\n\u05d6 /z/ (as in English \"zero\"),\n\u05e9\u05c1 /\u0283/ (as in English \"ship\"),\n\u05e6 /s\u02e4/ (the emphatic \u1e62\u0101\u1e0f\u00ea listed above).\nIn addition to these sets, Aramaic has the nasal consonants \u05de m and \u05e0 n, and the approximants \u05e8 r (usually an alveolar trill), \u05dc l, \u05d9 y and \u05d5 w.\n\nHistorical sound changes\nSix broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:\n\nVowel change occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.\nPlosive/fricative pair reduction.  Originally, Aramaic, like Tiberian Hebrew, had fricatives as conditioned allophones for each plosive. In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects. For example, Turoyo has mostly lost /p/, using /f/ instead, like Arabic; other dialects (for instance, standard Assyrian Neo-Aramaic) have lost /\u03b8/ and /\u00f0/ and replaced them with /t/ and /d/, as with Modern Hebrew. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, /f/ and /v/ are realized as [w] after a vowel.\nLoss of emphatics. Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the Caucasus often have glottalized rather than pharyngealized emphatics.\nGuttural assimilation is the main distinctive feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in Samaritan Hebrew: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce h in all words (the third person masculine pronoun hu becomes ow).\nProto-Semitic */\u03b8/ */\u00f0/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three is \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e9 \u0161\u0101l\u00f4\u0161 in Hebrew but \u05ea\u05dc\u05ea tl\u0101\u1e6f in Aramaic, the word gold is \u05d6\u05d4\u05d1 zahav in Hebrew but \u05d3\u05d4\u05d1 dehav in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.\nNew phonetic inventory. Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the dominant surrounding languages. The most frequent borrowings are [\u0292] (as the first consonant in \"azure\"), [d\u0361\u0292] (as in \"jam\"), and [t\u0361\u0283] (as in \"church\"). The Syriac alphabet has been adapted for writing these new sounds.\n\nGrammar\nAs in other Semitic languages, Aramaic morphology (the way words are formed) is based on the consonantal root. The root generally consists of two or three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, \u05db\u05ea\u05f4\u05d1 k-t-b has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:\n\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07\u00e2, handwriting, inscription, script, book.\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d9 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07\u00ea, books, the Scriptures.\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 k\u0101\u1e6f\u00fb\u1e07\u00e2, secretary, scribe.\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea ki\u1e6f\u1e07e\u1e6f, I wrote.\n\u05d0\u05db\u05ea\u05d1 'e\u1e35t\u00fb\u1e07, I shall write.\n\nNouns and adjectives\nAramaic nouns and adjectives are inflected to show gender, number and state.\nAramaic has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. The feminine absolute singular is often marked by the ending \u05d4- -\u00e2.\nNouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional \"dual\" number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.\nAramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states. To a certain extent, these states correspond to the role of articles and cases in the Indo-European languages:\n\nThe absolute state is the basic form of a noun. In early forms of Aramaic, the absolute state expresses indefiniteness, comparable to the English indefinite article a(n) (for example, \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07\u00e2, \"a handwriting\"), and can be used in most syntactic roles. However, by the Middle Aramaic period, its use for nouns (but not adjectives) had been widely replaced by the emphatic state.\nThe construct state is a form of the noun used to make possessive constructions (for example, \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07at malk\u1e6f\u00e2, \"the handwriting of the queen\"). In the masculine singular, the form of the construct is often the same as the absolute, but it may undergo vowel reduction in longer words. The feminine construct and masculine construct plural are marked by suffixes. Unlike a genitive case, which marks the possessor, the construct state is marked on the possessed. This is mainly due to Aramaic word order: possessed[const.] possessor[abs./emph.] are treated as a speech unit, with the first unit (possessed) employing the construct state to link it to the following word. In Middle Aramaic, the use of the construct state for all but stock phrases (like \u05d1\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0 bar n\u0101\u0161\u00e2, \"son of man\") begins to disappear.\nThe emphatic or determined state is an extended form of the noun that functions similarly to the definite article. It is marked with a suffix (for example, \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0  k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u00e2, \"the handwriting\"). Although its original grammatical function seems to have been to mark definiteness, it is used already in Imperial Aramaic to mark all important nouns, even if they should be considered technically indefinite. This practice developed to the extent that the absolute state became extraordinarily rare in later varieties of Aramaic.\nWhereas other Northwest Semitic languages, like Hebrew, have the absolute and construct states, the emphatic/determined state is a unique feature to Aramaic. Case endings, as in Ugaritic, probably existed in a very early stage of the language, and glimpses of them can be seen in a few compound proper names. However, as most of those cases were expressed by short final vowels, they were never written, and the few characteristic long vowels of the masculine plural accusative and genitive are not clearly evidenced in inscriptions. Often, the direct object is marked by a prefixed -\u05dc l- (the preposition \"to\") if it is definite.\nAdjectives agree with their nouns in number and gender but agree in state only if used attributively. Predicative adjectives are in the absolute state regardless of the state of their noun (a copula may or may not be written). Thus, an attributive adjective to an emphatic noun, as in the phrase \"the good king\", is written also in the emphatic state \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d0 \u05d8\u05d1\u05d0 malk\u00e2 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u00e2 \u2013 king[emph.] good[emph.]. In comparison, the predicative adjective, as in the phrase \"the king is good\", is written in the absolute state \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d0 \u05d8\u05d1 malk\u00e2 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07 \u2013 king[emph.] good[abs.].\n\nThe final \u05d0- -\u00e2 in a number of these suffixes is written with the letter aleph. However, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the letter he for the feminine absolute singular. Likewise, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the Hebrew masculine absolute singular suffix \u05d9\u05dd- -\u00eem instead of \u05d9\u05df- -\u00een. The masculine determined plural suffix, \u05d9\u05d0- -ayy\u00e2, has an alternative version, -\u00ea. The alternative is sometimes called the \"gentilic plural\" for its prominent use in ethnonyms (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d0 y\u0259h\u00fb\u1e0f\u0101y\u00ea, 'the Jews', for example). This alternative plural is written with the letter aleph, and came to be the only plural for nouns and adjectives of this type in Syriac and some other varieties of Aramaic. The masculine construct plural, -\u00ea, is written with yodh. In Syriac and some other variants this ending is diphthongized to -ai.\nPossessive phrases in Aramaic can either be made with the construct state or by linking two nouns with the relative particle -[\u05d3[\u05d9 d[\u00ee]-. As the use of the construct state almost disappears from the Middle Aramaic period on, the latter method became the main way of making possessive phrases.\nFor example, the various forms of possessive phrases (for \"the handwriting of the queen\") are:\n\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07a\u1e6f malk\u1e6f\u00e2 \u2013 the oldest construction, also known as \u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05ea s\u0259m\u00ee\u1e35\u00fb\u1e6f : the possessed object (\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4 k\u1e6f\u0101b\u00e2, \"handwriting\") is in the construct state (\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07a\u1e6f); the possessor (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 malk\u00e2, \"queen\") is in the emphatic state (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 malk\u1e6f\u00e2)\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0 \u05d3\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u00e2 d(\u00ee)-malk\u1e6f\u00e2 \u2013 both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle -[\u05d3[\u05d9 d[\u00ee]- is used to mark the relationship\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d3\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u0101h d(\u00ee)-malk\u1e6f\u00e2 \u2013 both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u0101-h, \"handwriting-her\"; literally, \"her writing, that (of) the queen\").\nIn Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.\n\nVerbs\nThe Aramaic verb has gradually evolved in time and place, varying between varieties of the language. Verb forms are marked for person (first, second or third), number (singular or plural), gender (masculine or feminine), tense (perfect or imperfect), mood (indicative, imperative, jussive, or infinitive), and voice (active, reflexive, or passive). Aramaic also employs a system of conjugations, or verbal stems, to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.\n\nAspectual tense\nAramaic has two proper tenses: perfect and imperfect. These were originally aspectual, but developed into something more like a preterite and future. The perfect is unmarked, while the imperfect uses various preformatives that vary according to person, number and gender. In both tenses the third-person singular masculine is the unmarked form from which others are derived by addition of afformatives (and preformatives in the imperfect). In the chart below (on the root \u05db\u05ea\u05f4\u05d1 K-T-B, meaning \"to write\"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is Classical Syriac.\n\nConjugations or verbal stems\nLike other Semitic languages, Aramaic employs a number of derived verb stems, to extend the lexical coverage of verbs. The basic form of the verb is called the ground stem, or G-stem. Following the tradition of mediaeval Arabic grammarians, it is more often called the P\u0259\u2018al \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc (also written Pe\u2018al), using the form of the Semitic root \u05e4\u05e2\u05f4\u05dc P-\u2018-L, meaning \"to do\". This stem carries the basic lexical meaning of the verb.\nBy doubling of the second radical, or root letter, the D-stem or \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Pa\u2018\u2018el is formed. This is often an intensive development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, q\u0259\u1e6dal means \"he killed\", whereas qa\u1e6d\u1e6del means \"he slew\". The precise relationship in meaning between the two stems differs for every verb.\nA preformative, which can be -\u05d4 ha-, -\u05d0 a-, or -\u05e9 \u0161a-, creates the C-stem or variously the Hap\u0304\u2018el, Ap\u0304\u2018el or \u0160ap\u0304\u2018el (also spelt \u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Haph\u2018el, \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Aph\u2018el, and \u05e9\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Shaph\u2018el). This is often an extensive or causative development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, \u05d8\u05e2\u05d4 \u1e6d\u0259\u2018\u00e2 means \"he went astray\", whereas \u05d0\u05d8\u05e2\u05d9 a\u1e6d\u2018\u00ee means \"he deceived\". The \u0160ap\u0304\u2018el \u05e9\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc is the least common variant of the C-stem. Because this variant is standard in Akkadian, it is possible that its use in Aramaic represents loanwords from that language. The difference between the variants \u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hap\u0304\u2018el and \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Ap\u0304\u2018el appears to be the gradual dropping of the initial \u05d4 h sound in later Old Aramaic. This is noted by the respelling of the older he preformative with \u05d0 aleph.\nThese three conjugations are supplemented with three further derived stems, produced by the preformative -\u05d4\u05ea hi\u1e6f- or -\u05d0\u05ea e\u1e6f-. The loss of the initial \u05d4 h sound occurs similarly to that in the form above. These three derived stems are the Gt-stem, \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hi\u1e6fp\u0259\u2018el or \u05d0\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc E\u1e6fp\u0259\u2018el (also written Hithpe\u2018el or Ethpe\u2018el), the Dt-stem, \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05bc\u05dc Hi\u1e6fpa\u2018\u2018al or \u05d0\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05bc\u05dc E\u1e6fpa\u2018\u2018al (also written Hithpa\u2018\u2018al or Ethpa\u2018\u2018al), and the Ct-stem, \u05d4\u05ea\u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hi\u1e6fhap\u0304\u2018al, \u05d0\u05ea\u05bc\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Ettap\u0304\u2018al, \u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hi\u0161tap\u0304\u2018al or \u05d0\u05e9\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc E\u0161tap\u0304\u2018al (also written Hithhaph\u2018al, Ettaph\u2018al, Hishtaph\u2018al, or Eshtaph\u2018al). Their meaning is usually reflexive, but later became passive. However, as with other stems, actual meaning differs from verb to verb.\nNot all verbs use all of these conjugations, and, in some, the G-stem is not used. In the chart below (on the root \u05db\u05ea\u05f4\u05d1 K-T-B, meaning \"to write\"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is Classical Syriac.\n\nIn Imperial Aramaic, the participle began to be used for a historical present. Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an auxiliary verb), allowing for narrative that is more vivid. Aramaic syntax usually follows the order verb\u2013subject\u2013object (VSO).  Imperial (Persian) Aramaic, however, tended to follow a S-O-V pattern (similar to Akkadian), which was the result of Persian syntactic influence.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\nExternal links\n\nAncient Aramaic Audio Files: Contains audio recordings of scripture.\nThe Aramaic Language and Its Classification \u2013 Efrem Yildiz, Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies Archived 2008-09-09 at the Wayback Machine\nComprehensive Aramaic Lexicon (including editions of Targums) at the Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati\nDictionary of Judeo-Aramaic\nJewish Language Research Website: Jewish Aramaic Archived 2008-05-11 at the Wayback Machine", "ai_summary": "To effectively translate text into Aramaic, a translator must have a comprehensive understanding of its grammar, phonology, writing systems, and historical context. Here is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article:\n\n### Writing System\n- **Aramaic Alphabet**: Aramaic is written in the Aramaic alphabet, a descendant of the Phoenician alphabet. The most prominent variant is the Syriac alphabet. Other derivatives include the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets.\n- **Scripts**: The Syriac alphabet is used by Christian communities, while the Mandaic alphabet is used by the Mandaeans. The Nabataean and Palmyrene alphabets were used in ancient times.\n- **Modern Scripts**: Turoyo has sometimes been written in a Latin script.\n\n### Phonology\n- **Vowels**: Aramaic has three basic sets of vowels: open a-vowels, close front i-vowels, and close back u-vowels. Diphthongs include ay and aw.\n- **Consonants**: Aramaic uses a series of plosives and fricatives, with emphatic consonants pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted. The guttural consonants include \u1e24\u00ea\u1e6f, \u02bdAyin, and others.\n- **Sound Changes**: Dialects exhibit vowel changes, plosive/fricative pair reduction, loss of emphatics, guttural assimilation, and borrowing from surrounding languages.\n\n### Grammar\n- **Nouns and Adjectives**: \n  - **Gender**: Masculine and feminine.\n  - **Number**: Singular, plural, and dual (though dual is rare in later stages).\n  - **States**: Absolute (indefinite), construct (possessive), and emphatic (definite).\n  - **Suffixes**: Various suffixes indicate gender, number, and state.\n\n- **Verbs**:\n  - **Tenses**: Perfect and imperfect, originally aspectual but later more like preterite and future.\n  - **Conjugations**: \n    - **G-stem (P\u0259\u2018al)**: Basic form.\n    - **D-stem (Pa\u2018\u2018el)**: Intensive form.\n    - **C-stem (Hap\u0304\u2018el, Ap\u0304\u2018el, \u0160ap\u0304\u2018el)**: Extensive or causative.\n    - **Gt-stem, Dt-stem, Ct-stem**: Reflexive or passive.\n  - **Aspectual Tense**: Perfect is unmarked; imperfect uses preformatives.\n  - **Verb Conjugation Table**: Provides forms for different persons, numbers, and genders.\n\n### Historical Context and Dialects\n- **Periodization**: \n  - **Old Aramaic**: Up to 200 AD.\n  - **Middle Aramaic**: 200 AD to 1200 AD.\n  - **Modern Aramaic**: 1200 AD to present.\n- **Dialects**: \n  - **Eastern Aramaic**: Includes Classical Syriac, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, and Mandaic.\n  - **Western Aramaic**: Includes Jewish Palestinian Aramaic and Samaritan Aramaic.\n  - **Modern Dialects**: Neo-Aramaic languages like Suret and Turoyo.\n\n### Translation Considerations\n- **Loanwords and Influences**: Aramaic has borrowed from Hebrew, Akkadian, Persian, and Arabic, among others.\n- **Syntax**: Typically follows a verb\u2013subject\u2013object (VSO) order, though Persian influence led to a subject-object-verb (SOV) order in Imperial Aramaic.\n- **Literary and Liturgical Use**: Aramaic is used in religious texts across Judaism, Christianity, and Mandaeism.\n\n### Additional Resources\n- **Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon**: A valuable resource for translations.\n- **Dictionary of Judeo-Aramaic**: Useful for understanding Jewish Aramaic dialects.\n\nThis detailed information provides a solid foundation for translating text into Aramaic, considering its complex history, diverse dialects, and rich grammatical structure.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:01:31.632300"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language": {"base_content": "Japanese (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, Nihongo, [\u0272iho\u014b\u0261o] ) is the principal language of the Japonic language family spoken by the Japanese people. It has around 123 million speakers, primarily in Japan, the only country where it is the national language, and within the Japanese diaspora worldwide.\nThe Japonic family also includes the Ryukyuan languages and the variously classified Hachij\u014d language. There have been many attempts to group the Japonic languages with other families such as Ainu, Austronesian, Koreanic, and the now discredited Altaic, but none of these proposals have gained any widespread acceptance.\nLittle is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century AD recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial Old Japanese texts did not appear until the 8th century. From the Heian period (794\u20131185), extensive waves of Sino-Japanese vocabulary entered the language, affecting the phonology of Early Middle Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (1185\u20131600) saw extensive grammatical changes and the first appearance of European loanwords. The basis of the standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo region (modern Tokyo) in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th century\u2013mid 19th century). Following the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly, and words from English roots have proliferated.\nJapanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with relatively simple phonotactics, a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and consonant length, and a lexically significant pitch-accent. Word order is normally subject\u2013object\u2013verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is topic\u2013comment. Sentence-final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or form questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no articles. Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person. Japanese adjectives are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics, with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.\nThe Japanese writing system combines Chinese characters, known as kanji (\u6f22\u5b57, 'Han characters'), with two unique syllabaries (or moraic scripts) derived by the Japanese from the more complex Chinese characters: hiragana (\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a or \u5e73\u4eee\u540d, 'simple characters') and katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca or \u7247\u4eee\u540d, 'partial characters'). Latin script (r\u014dmaji \u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57) is also used in a limited fashion (such as for imported acronyms) in Japanese writing. The numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals, but also traditional Chinese numerals.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nProto-Japonic, the common ancestor of the Japanese and Ryukyuan languages, is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from the Korean peninsula sometime in the early- to mid-4th century BC (the Yayoi period), replacing the languages of the original J\u014dmon inhabitants, including the ancestor of the modern Ainu language. Because writing had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period must be based on internal reconstruction from Old Japanese, or comparison with the Ryukyuan languages and Japanese dialects.\n\nOld Japanese\nThe Chinese writing system was imported to Japan from Baekje around the start of the fifth century, alongside Buddhism. The earliest texts were written in Classical Chinese, although some of these were likely intended to be read as Japanese using the kanbun method, and show influences of Japanese grammar such as Japanese word order. The earliest text, the Kojiki, dates to the early eighth century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters, which are used to represent, at different times, Chinese, kanbun, and Old Japanese. As in other texts from this period, the Old Japanese sections are written in Man'y\u014dgana, which uses kanji for their phonetic as well as semantic values.\nBased on the Man'y\u014dgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct morae. Texts written with Man'y\u014dgana use two different sets of kanji for each of the morae now pronounced \u304d (ki), \u3072 (hi), \u307f (mi), \u3051 (ke), \u3078 (he), \u3081 (me), \u3053 (ko), \u305d (so), \u3068 (to), \u306e (no), \u3082 (mo), \u3088 (yo) and \u308d (ro). (The Kojiki has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo1 and mo2 apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of morae shrank to 67 in Early Middle Japanese, though some were added through Chinese influence. Man'y\u014dgana also has a symbol for /je/, which merges with /e/ before the end of the period.\nSeveral fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language \u2013 the genitive particle tsu (superseded by modern no) is preserved in words such as matsuge (\"eyelash\", lit. \"hair of the eye\"); modern mieru (\"to be visible\") and kikoeru (\"to be audible\") retain a mediopassive suffix -yu(ru) (kikoyu \u2192 kikoyuru (the attributive form, which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period) \u2192 kikoeru (all verbs with the shimo-nidan conjugation pattern underwent this same shift in Early Modern Japanese)); and the genitive particle ga remains in intentionally archaic speech.\n\nEarly Middle Japanese\nEarly Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the Heian period, from 794 to 1185. It formed the basis for the literary standard of Classical Japanese, which remained in common use until the early 20th century.\nDuring this time, Japanese underwent numerous phonological developments, in many cases instigated by an influx of Chinese loanwords. These included phonemic length distinction for both consonants and vowels, palatal consonants (e.g. kya) and labial consonant clusters (e.g. kwa), and closed syllables. This had the effect of changing Japanese into a mora-timed language.\n\nLate Middle Japanese\nLate Middle Japanese covers the years from 1185 to 1600, and is normally divided into two sections, roughly equivalent to the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, respectively. The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non-native sources, in this case the Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries; and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms (for instance, the Arte da Lingoa de Iapam). Among other sound changes, the sequence /au/ merges to /\u0254\u02d0/, in contrast with /o\u02d0/; /p/ is reintroduced from Chinese; and /we/ merges with /je/. Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear \u2013 the continuative ending -te begins to reduce onto the verb (e.g. yonde for earlier yomite), the -k- in the final mora of adjectives drops out (shiroi for earlier shiroki); and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form (e.g. hayaku > hayau > hay\u0254\u0254, where modern Japanese just has hayaku, though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting o-hay\u014d gozaimasu \"good morning\"; this ending is also seen in o-medet\u014d \"congratulations\", from medetaku).\nLate Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages \u2013 now-common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include pan (\"bread\") and tabako (\"tobacco\", now \"cigarette\"), both from Portuguese.\n\nModern Japanese\nModern Japanese is considered to begin with the Edo period (which spanned from 1603 to 1867). Since Old Japanese, the de facto standard Japanese had been the Kansai dialect, especially that of Kyoto. However, during the Edo period, Edo (now Tokyo) developed into the largest city in Japan, and the Edo-area dialect became standard Japanese. Since the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly. The period since 1945 has seen many words borrowed from other languages\u2014such as German (e.g. arubaito 'temporary job', wakuchin 'vaccine'), Portuguese (kasutera 'sponge cake') and English. Many English loan words especially relate to technology\u2014for example, pasokon 'personal computer', int\u0101netto 'internet', and kamera 'camera'. Due to the large quantity of English loanwords, modern Japanese has developed a distinction between [t\u0255i] and [ti], and [d\u0291i] and [di], with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords, eg. paati for party or dizunii for Disney.\n\nGeographic distribution\nAlthough Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has also been spoken outside of the country. Before and during World War II, through Japanese annexation of Taiwan and Korea, as well as partial occupation of China, the Philippines, and various Pacific islands, locals in those countries learned Japanese as the language of the empire. As a result, many elderly people in these countries can still speak Japanese.\nJapanese emigrant communities (the largest of which are to be found in Brazil, with 1.4 million to 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants, according to Brazilian IBGE data, more than the 1.2 million of the United States) sometimes employ Japanese as their primary language. Approximately 12% of Hawaii residents speak Japanese, with an estimated 12.6% of the population of Japanese ancestry in 2008. Japanese emigrants can also be found in Peru, Argentina, Australia (especially in the eastern states), Canada (especially in Vancouver, where 1.4% of the population has Japanese ancestry), the United States (notably in Hawaii, where 16.7% of the population has Japanese ancestry, and California), and the Philippines (particularly in Davao Region and the Province of Laguna).\n\nOfficial status\nJapanese has no official status in Japan, but is the de facto national language of the country. There is a form of the language considered standard: hy\u014djungo (\u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e), meaning \"standard Japanese\", or ky\u014dts\u016bgo (\u5171\u901a\u8a9e), \"common language\", or even \"Tokyo dialect\" at times. The meanings of the two terms (''hy\u014djungo'' and ''ky\u014dts\u016bgo'') are almost the same. Hy\u014djungo or ky\u014dts\u016bgo is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect. This normative language was born after the Meiji Restoration (\u660e\u6cbb\u7dad\u65b0, meiji ishin, 1868) from the language spoken in the higher-class areas of Tokyo (see Yamanote). Hy\u014djungo is taught in schools and used on television and in official communications. It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.\nFormerly, standard Japanese in writing (\u6587\u8a9e, bungo, \"literary language\") was different from colloquial language (\u53e3\u8a9e, k\u014dgo). The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. Bungo was the main method of writing Japanese until about 1900; since then k\u014dgo gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the 1940s. Bungo still has some relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in bungo, although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). K\u014dgo is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today, although bungo grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect.\nJapanese is, along with Palauan and English, an official language of Angaur, Palau according to the 1982 state constitution. At the time it was written, many of the elders participating in the process had been educated in Japanese during the South Seas Mandate over the island, as shown by the 1958 census of the Trust Territory of the Pacific which found that 89% of Palauans born between 1914 and 1933 could speak and read Japanese. However, as of the 2005 Palau census, no residents of Angaur were reported to speak Japanese at home.\n\nDialects and mutual intelligibility\nJapanese dialects typically differ in terms of pitch accent, inflectional morphology, vocabulary, and particle usage. Some even differ in vowel and consonant inventories, although this is less common.\nIn terms of mutual intelligibility, a survey in 1967 found that the four most unintelligible dialects (excluding Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages and T\u014dhoku dialects) to students from Greater Tokyo were the Kiso dialect (in the deep mountains of Nagano Prefecture), the Himi dialect (in Toyama Prefecture), the Kagoshima dialect and the Maniwa dialect (in Okayama Prefecture). The survey was based on 12- to 20-second-long recordings of 135 to 244 phonemes, which 42 students listened to and translated word-for-word. The listeners were all Keio University students who grew up in the Kant\u014d region.\n\nThere are some language islands in mountain villages or isolated islands such as Hachij\u014d-jima island, whose dialects are descended from Eastern Old Japanese. Dialects of the Kansai region are spoken or known by many Japanese, and Osaka dialect in particular is associated with comedy (see Kansai dialect). Dialects of T\u014dhoku and North Kant\u014d are associated with typical farmers.\nThe Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages, spoken in Okinawa and the Amami Islands (administratively part of Kagoshima), are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the Japonic family; not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers, but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages. However, in contrast to linguists, many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages as dialects of Japanese.\nThe imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time, most likely the spoken form of Classical Japanese, a writing style that was prevalent during the Heian period, but began to decline during the late Meiji period. The Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages are classified by UNESCO as 'endangered', as young people mostly use Japanese and cannot understand the languages. Okinawan Japanese is a variant of Standard Japanese influenced by the Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages, and is the primary dialect spoken among young people in the Ryukyu Islands.\nModern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide (including the Ry\u016bky\u016b islands) due to education, mass media, and an increase in mobility within Japan, as well as economic integration.\n\nClassification\nJapanese is a member of the Japonic language family, which also includes the Ryukyuan languages spoken in the Ryukyu Islands. As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language, Japanese is sometimes called a language isolate.\nAccording to Martine Robbeets, Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world. Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late 19th century, attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as Ainu, Korean, Chinese, Tibeto-Burman, Uralic, Altaic (or Ural-Altaic), Austroasiatic, Austronesian and Dravidian. At the fringe, some linguists have even suggested a link to Indo-European languages, including Greek, or to Sumerian. Main modern theories try to link Japanese either to northern Asian languages, like Korean or the proposed larger Altaic family, or to various Southeast Asian languages, especially Austronesian. None of these proposals have gained wide acceptance (and the Altaic family itself is now considered controversial). As it stands, only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support.\nOther theories view the Japanese language as an early creole language formed through inputs from at least two distinct language groups, or as a distinct language of its own that has absorbed various aspects from neighboring languages.\n\nPhonology\nVowels\nJapanese has five vowels, and vowel length is phonemic, with each having both a short and a long version. Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel (a macron) in r\u014dmaji, a repeated vowel character in hiragana, or a ch\u014donpu succeeding the vowel in katakana. /u/ () is compressed rather than protruded, or simply unrounded.\n\nConsonants\nSome Japanese consonants have several allophones, which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds. However, some of these allophones have since become phonemic. For example, in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the 20th century, the phonemic sequence /ti/ was palatalized and realized phonetically as [t\u0255i], approximately chi (); however, now [ti] and [t\u0255i] are distinct, as evidenced by words like t\u012b [ti\u02d0] \"Western-style tea\" and chii [t\u0255ii] \"social status\".\nThe \"r\" of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an apical central tap and a lateral approximant. The \"g\" is also notable; unless it starts a sentence, it may be pronounced [\u014b], in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects.\nThe phonotactics of Japanese are relatively simple. The syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C), that is, a core vowel surrounded by an optional onset consonant, a glide /j/ and either the first part of a geminate consonant (\u3063/\u30c3, represented as Q) or a moraic nasal in the coda (\u3093/\u30f3, represented as N).\nThe nasal is sensitive to its phonetic environment and assimilates to the following phoneme, with pronunciations including [\u0274, m, n, \u0272, \u014b, \u0270\u0303]. Onset-glide clusters only occur at the start of syllables but clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are the moraic nasal followed by a homorganic consonant.\nJapanese also includes a pitch accent, which is not represented in moraic writing; for example [ha\ua71c.\u0255i] (\"chopsticks\") and [ha.\u0255i\ua71c] (\"bridge\") are both spelled \u306f\u3057 (hashi), and are only differentiated by the tone contour.\n\nWriting system\nHistory\nLiteracy was introduced to Japan in the form of the Chinese writing system, by way of Baekje before the 5th century AD. Using this script, the Japanese king Bu presented a petition to Emperor Shun of Song in AD 478. After the ruin of Baekje, Japan invited scholars from China to learn more of the Chinese writing system. Japanese emperors gave an official rank to Chinese scholars (\u7d9a\u5b88\u8a00/\u85a9\u5f18\u606a/\u8881\u664b\u537f) and spread the use of Chinese characters during the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\nAt first, the Japanese wrote in Classical Chinese, with Japanese names represented by characters used for their meanings and not their sounds. Later, during the 7th century AD, the Chinese-sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose, but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound. This was the beginning of Japanese as a written language in its own right. By this time, the Japanese language was already very distinct from the Ryukyuan languages.\nAn example of this mixed style is the Kojiki, which was written in AD 712. Japanese writers then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as man'y\u014dgana, a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech mora by mora.\nOver time, a writing system evolved. Chinese characters (kanji) were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese, or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings. Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements; these were simplified, and eventually became two moraic scripts: hiragana and katakana which were developed based on Man'y\u014dgana. Some scholars claim that Manyogana originated from Baekje, but this hypothesis is denied by mainstream Japanese scholars.\nHiragana and katakana were first simplified from kanji, and hiragana, emerging somewhere around the 9th century, was mainly used by women. Hiragana was seen as an informal language, whereas katakana and kanji were considered more formal and were typically used by men and in official settings. However, because of hiragana's accessibility, more and more people began using it. Eventually, by the 10th century, hiragana was used by everyone.\nModern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: kanji, characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese loanwords into Japanese and a number of native Japanese morphemes; and two syllabaries: hiragana and katakana. The Latin script (or r\u014dmaji in Japanese) is used to a certain extent, such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non-Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word (such as \"ramen\" at a restaurant). Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji numerals when used in counting, but kanji numerals are still used in compounds, such as \u7d71\u4e00 (t\u014ditsu, \"unification\").\nHistorically, attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid-19th century, but government did not intervene until after Japan's defeat in the Second World War. During the post-war occupation (and influenced by the views of some U.S. officials), various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of r\u014dmaji were considered. The j\u014dy\u014d kanji (\"common use kanji\"), originally called t\u014dy\u014d kanji (kanji for general use) scheme arose as a compromise solution.\nJapanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school. A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the list of ky\u014diku kanji (\"education kanji\", a subset of j\u014dy\u014d kanji), specifies the 1,006 simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade. Children continue to study another 1,130 characters in junior high school, covering in total 2,136 j\u014dy\u014d kanji. The official list of j\u014dy\u014d kanji has been revised several times, but the total number of officially sanctioned characters has remained largely unchanged.\nAs for kanji for personal names, the circumstances are somewhat complicated. J\u014dy\u014d kanji and jinmeiy\u014d kanji (an appendix of additional characters for names) are approved for registering personal names. Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration. However, as with the list of j\u014dy\u014d kanji, criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use. Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful, the list of jinmeiy\u014d kanji was substantially extended from 92 in 1951 (the year it was first decreed) to 983 in 2004. Furthermore, families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms.\n\nHiragana\nHiragana are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, for replacement of rare kanji that may be unfamiliar to intended readers, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs (and adjectives) in Japanese are conjugated, kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing their meaning. For this reason, hiragana are appended to kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations. Hiragana used in this way are called okurigana. Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called furigana above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading. This is done to facilitate learning, as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure (or sometimes invented) readings.\n\nKatakana\nKatakana, like hiragana, constitute a syllabary; katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, \"Australia\" has been adapted as \u014csutoraria (\u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2), and \"supermarket\" has been adapted and shortened into s\u016bp\u0101 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc).\n\nGrammar\nSentence structure\nJapanese word order is classified as subject\u2013object\u2013verb. Unlike many Indo-European languages, the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence (possibly followed by sentence-end particles). This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with particles that identify their grammatical functions.\nThe basic sentence structure is topic\u2013comment. Once the topic has been stated using the particle wa (\u306f), it is normally omitted in subsequent sentences, and the next use of wa will change the topic. For instance, someone may begin a conversation with a sentence that includes Tanaka-san wa... (\u7530\u4e2d\u3055\u3093\u306f..., \"As for Mx. Tanaka, ...\"). Each person may say a number of comments regarding Tanaka as the topic, and someone could change the topic to Naoko with a sentence including Naoko-san wa... (\u76f4\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u306f..., \"As for Mx. Naoko, ...\"). \nAs these example translations illustrate, a sentence may include a topic, but the topic is not part of sentence's core statement. Japanese is often called a topic-prominent language because of its strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject, and the two do not always coincide. That is, a sentence might not involve the topic directly at all. To replicate this effect in English, consider \"As for Naoko, people are rude.\" The topic, \"Naoko,\" provides context to the comment about the subject, \"people,\" and the sentence as a whole indicates that \"people are rude\" is a statement relevant to Naoko. However, the sentence's comment does not describe Naoko directly at all, and whatever the sentence indicates about Naoko is an inference. The topic is not the core of the sentence; the core of the sentence is always the comment.\nIn a basic comment, the subject is marked with the particle ga (\u304c), and the rest of the comment describes the subject. For example, in Zou ga doubutsu da (\u8c61\u304c\u52d5\u7269\u3060), ga indicates that \"elephant\" is the subject of the sentence. Context determines whether the speaker means a single elephant or elephants plural. The copula da (\u3060, the verb \"is\") ends the sentence, indicating that the subject is equivalent to the rest of the comment. Here, doubutsu means animal. Therefore, the sentence means \"[The] elephant is [an] animal\" or \"Elephants are animals.\" A basic comment can end in three ways: with the copula da, with a different verb, or with an adjective ending in the kana i (\u3044). A sentence ending might also be decorated with particles that alter the way the sentence is meant to be interpreted, as in Zou ga doubutsu da yo (\u8c61\u304c\u52d5\u7269\u3060\u3088, \"Elephants are animals, you know.\"). This is also why da is replaced with desu (\u3067\u3059) when the speaker is talking to someone they do not know well: it makes the sentence more polite.\nOften, ga implies distinction of the subject within the topic, so the previous example comment would make the most sense within a topic where not all of the relevant subjects were animals. For example, in Kono ganbutsu wa zou ga doubutsu da (\u3053\u306e\u8d0b\u7269\u306f\u8c61\u304c\u52d5\u7269\u3060), the particle wa indicates the topic is kono ganbutsu (\"this toy\" or \"these toys\"). In English, if there are many toys and one is an elephant, this could mean \"Among these toys, [the] elephant is [an] animal.\" That said, if the subject is clearly a subtopic, this differentiation effect may or may not be relevant, such as in nihongo wa bunpo ga yasashii (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306f\u6587\u6cd5\u304c\u512a\u3057\u3044). The equivalent sentence, \"As for the Japanese language, grammar is easy,\" might be a general statement that Japanese grammar is easy or a statement that grammar is an especially easy feature of the Japanese language. Context should reveal which.\nBecause ga marks the subject of the sentence but the sentence overall is intended to be relevant to the topic indicated by wa, translations of Japanese into English often elide the difference between these particles. For example, the phrase watashi wa zou ga suki da literally means \"As for myself, elephants are likeable.\" The sentence about myself describes elephants as having a likeable quality. From this, it is clear that I like elephants, and this sentence is often translated into English as \"I like elephants.\" However, to do so changes the subject of the sentence (from \"Elephant\" to \"I\") and the verb (from \"is\" to \"like\"); it does not reflect Japanese grammar.\nJapanese grammar tends toward brevity; the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated and pronouns may be omitted if they can be inferred from context. In the example above, zou ga doubutsu da would mean \"[the] elephant is [an] animal\", while doubutsu da by itself would mean \"[they] are animals.\" In especially casual speech, many speakers would omit the copula, leaving the noun doubutsu to mean \"[they are] animals.\" A single verb can be a complete sentence: Yatta! (\u3084\u3063\u305f!, \"[I / we / they / etc] did [it]!\"). In addition, since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence (below), a single adjective can be a complete sentence: Urayamashii! (\u7fa8\u307e\u3057\u3044!, \"[I'm] jealous [about it]!\")).\nNevertheless, unlike the topic, the subject is always implied: all sentences which omit a ga particle must have an implied subject that could be specified with a ga particle. For example, Kono neko wa Loki da (\u3053\u306e\u732b\u306f\u30ed\u30ad\u3060) means \"As for this cat, [it] is Loki.\" An equivalent sentence might read kono neko wa kore ga Loki da (\u3053\u306e\u732b\u306f\u3053\u308c\u304c\u30ed\u30ad\u3060), meaning \"As for this cat, this is Loki.\" However, in the same way it is unusual to state the subject twice in the English sentence, it is unusual to specify that redundant subject in Japanese. Rather than replace the redundant subject with a word like \"it,\" the redundant subject is omitted from the Japanese sentence. It is obvious from the context that the first sentence refers to the cat by the name \"Loki,\" and the explicit subject of the second sentence contributes no information. \nWhile the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns, these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo-European languages, and function differently. In some cases, Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action: \"down\" to indicate the out-group gives a benefit to the in-group, and \"up\" to indicate the in-group gives a benefit to the out-group. Here, the in-group includes the speaker and the out-group does not, and their boundary depends on context. For example, oshiete moratta (\u6559\u3048\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f, literally, \"explaining got\" with a benefit from the out-group to the in-group) means \"[he/she/they] explained [it] to [me/us]\". Similarly, oshiete ageta (\u6559\u3048\u3066\u3042\u3052\u305f, literally, \"explaining gave\" with a benefit from the in-group to the out-group) means \"[I/we] explained [it] to [him/her/them]\". Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo-European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action.\nJapanese \"pronouns\" also function differently from most modern Indo-European pronouns (and more like nouns) in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may. For instance, one does not say in English:\n\nThe amazed he ran down the street. (grammatically incorrect insertion of a pronoun)\nBut one can grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese:\n\nThis is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns, such as kimi \"you\" (\u541b \"lord\"), anata \"you\" (\u3042\u306a\u305f \"that side, yonder\"), and boku \"I\" (\u50d5 \"servant\"). This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese \"pronouns\" as pronouns, but rather as referential nouns, much like Spanish usted (contracted from vuestra merced, \"your (majestic plural) grace\") or Portuguese voc\u00ea (from vossa merc\u00ea). Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom.\nThe choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken: men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as watashi (\u79c1, literally \"private\") or watakushi (also \u79c1, hyper-polite form), while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word ore (\u4ffa, \"oneself\", \"myself\") or boku. Similarly, different words such as anata, kimi, and omae (\u304a\u524d, more formally \u5fa1\u524d \"the one before me\") may refer to a listener depending on the listener's relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener. When used in different social relationships, the same word may have positive (intimate or respectful) or negative (distant or disrespectful) connotations.\nJapanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English. For example, when speaking to one's teacher, it is appropriate to use sensei (\u5148\u751f, \"teacher\"), but inappropriate to use anata. This is because anata is used to refer to people of equal or lower status, and one's teacher has higher status.\n\nInflection and conjugation\nJapanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun hon (\u672c) may refer to a single book or several books; hito (\u4eba) can mean \"person\" or \"people\", and ki (\u6728) can be \"tree\" or \"trees\". Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a counter word) or (rarely) by adding a suffix,  or sometimes by duplication (e.g. \u4eba\u4eba, hitobito, usually written with an iteration mark as \u4eba\u3005). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus Tanaka-san usually means Mx Tanaka. Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as -tachi, but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase \"and company\". A group described as Tanaka-san-tachi may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as hitobito \"people\" and wareware \"we/us\", while the word tomodachi \"friend\" is considered singular, although plural in form.\nVerbs are conjugated to show tenses, of which there are two: past and non-past, which is used for the present and the future. For verbs that represent an ongoing process, the -te iru form indicates a continuous (or progressive) aspect, similar to the suffix ing in English. For others that represent a change of state, the -te iru form indicates a perfect aspect. For example, kite iru means \"They have come (and are still here)\", but tabete iru means \"They are eating\".\nQuestions (both with an interrogative pronoun and yes/no questions) have the same structure as affirmative sentences, but with intonation rising at the end. In the formal register, the question particle -ka is added. For example, ii desu (\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059, \"It is OK\") becomes ii desu-ka (\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002, \"Is it OK?\"). In a more informal tone sometimes the particle -no (\u306e) is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: D\u014dshite konai-no? \"Why aren't (you) coming?\". Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer's attention: Kore wa? \"(What about) this?\"; O-namae wa? (\u304a\u540d\u524d\u306f\uff1f) \"(What's your) name?\".\nNegatives are formed by inflecting the verb. For example, Pan o taberu (\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3002, \"I will eat bread\" or \"I eat bread\") becomes Pan o tabenai (\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u98df\u3079\u306a\u3044\u3002, \"I will not eat bread\" or \"I do not eat bread\"). Plain negative forms are i-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. Pan o tabenakatta (\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u98df\u3079\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002, \"I did not eat bread\").\nThe so-called -te verb form is used for a variety of purposes: either progressive or perfect aspect (see above); combining verbs in a temporal sequence (Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru \"I'll eat breakfast and leave at once\"), simple commands, conditional statements and permissions (Dekakete-mo ii? \"May I go out?\"), etc.\nThe word da (plain), desu (polite) is the copula verb. It corresponds to the English verb is and marks tense when the verb is conjugated into its past form datta (plain), deshita (polite). This comes into use because only i-adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese. Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence (\"there is\") or, in some contexts, property: aru (negative nai) and iru (negative inai), for inanimate and animate things, respectively. For example, Neko ga iru \"There's a cat\", Ii kangae-ga nai \"[I] haven't got a good idea\".\nThe verb \"to do\" (suru, polite form shimasu) is often used to make verbs from nouns (ry\u014dri suru \"to cook\", benky\u014d suru \"to study\", etc.) and has been productive in creating modern slang words. Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. tobidasu \"to fly out, to flee\", from tobu \"to fly, to jump\" + dasu \"to put out, to emit\").\nThere are three types of adjectives (see Japanese adjectives):\n\n\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e keiy\u014dshi, or i adjectives, which have a conjugating ending i (\u3044). An example of this is \u6691\u3044 (atsui, \"to be hot\"), which can become past (\u6691\u304b\u3063\u305f atsukatta \"it was hot\"), or negative (\u6691\u304f\u306a\u3044 atsuku nai \"it is not hot\"). nai is also an i adjective, which can become past (i.e., \u6691\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f atsuku nakatta \"it was not hot\").\n\u6691\u3044\u65e5 atsui hi \"a hot day\".\n\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e keiy\u014dd\u014dshi, or na adjectives, which are followed by a form of the copula, usually na. For example, hen (strange)\n\u5909\u306a\u4eba hen na hito \"a strange person\".\n\u9023\u4f53\u8a5e rentaishi, also called true adjectives, such as ano \"that\"\n\u3042\u306e\u5c71 ano yama \"that mountain\".\nBoth keiy\u014dshi and keiy\u014dd\u014dshi may predicate sentences. For example,\n\nBoth inflect, though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs.\nThe rentaishi in Modern Japanese are few in number, and unlike the other words, are limited to directly modifying nouns. They never predicate sentences. Examples include ookina \"big\", kono \"this\", iwayuru \"so-called\" and taishita \"amazing\".\nBoth keiy\u014dd\u014dshi and keiy\u014dshi form adverbs, by following with ni in the case of keiy\u014dd\u014dshi:\n\n\u5909\u306b\u306a\u308b hen ni naru \"become strange\",\nand by changing i to ku in the case of keiy\u014dshi:\n\n\u71b1\u304f\u306a\u308b atsuku naru \"become hot\".\nThe grammatical function of nouns is indicated by postpositions, also called particles. These include for example:\n\n\u304c ga for the nominative case.\n\u5f7c\u304c\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3002 Kare ga yatta. \"He did it.\"\n\u3092 o for the accusative case.\n\u4f55\u3092\u98df\u3079\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002 Nani o tabemasu ka? \"What will (you) eat?\"\n\u306b ni for the dative case.\n\u7530\u4e2d\u3055\u3093\u306b\u3042\u3052\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044\u3002 Tanaka-san ni agete kudasai \"Please give it to Mx Tanaka.\"\nIt is also used for the lative case, indicating a motion to a location.\n\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u884c\u304d\u305f\u3044\u3002 Nihon ni ikitai \"I want to go to Japan.\"\nHowever, \u3078 e is more commonly used for the lative case.\n\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3078\u884c\u304b\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3002 p\u0101t\u012b e ikanai ka? \"Won't you go to the party?\"\n\u306e no for the genitive case, or nominalizing phrases.\n\u79c1\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3002 watashi no kamera \"my camera\"\n\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u306b\u884c\u304f\u306e\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002 Suk\u012b-ni iku no ga suki desu \"(I) like going skiing.\"\n\u306f wa for the topic. It can co-exist with the case markers listed above, and it overrides ga and (in most cases) o.\n\u79c1\u306f\u5bff\u53f8\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002 Watashi wa sushi ga ii desu. (literally) \"As for me, sushi is good.\" The nominative marker ga after watashi is hidden under wa.\nNote: The subtle difference between wa and ga in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such, because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there. While wa indicates the topic, which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon, it carries the implication that the subject indicated by wa is not unique, or may be part of a larger group.\n\nIkeda-san wa yonj\u016b-ni sai da. \"As for Mx Ikeda, they are forty-two years old.\" Others in the group may also be of that age.\nAbsence of wa often means the subject is the focus of the sentence.\n\nIkeda-san ga yonj\u016b-ni sai da. \"It is Mx Ikeda who is forty-two years old.\" This is a reply to an implicit or explicit question, such as \"who in this group is forty-two years old?\"\n\nPoliteness\nJapanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality. This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society.\nThe Japanese language can express differing levels of social status. The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job, age, experience, or even psychological state (e.g., a person asking a favour tends to do so politely). The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech, whereas the other person might use a plainer form. Strangers will also speak to each other politely. Japanese children begin learning and using polite speech in basic forms from an early age, but their use of more formal and sophisticated polite speech becomes more common and expected as they enter their teenage years and start engaging in more adult-like social interactions. See uchi\u2013soto.\nWhereas teineigo (\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e, polite language) is commonly an inflectional system, sonkeigo (\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e, respectful language) and kenj\u014dgo (\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e, humble language) often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs: iku \"go\" becomes ikimasu in polite form, but is replaced by irassharu in honorific speech and ukagau or mairu in humble speech.\nThe difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group. For example, the -san suffix (\"Mr\", \"Mrs\", \"Miss\", or \"Mx\") is an example of honorific language. It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one's company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's in-group. When speaking directly to one's superior in one's company or when speaking with other employees within one's company about a superior, a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in-group superior and their speech and actions. When speaking to a person from another company (i.e., a member of an out-group), however, a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their in-group superiors. In short, the register used in Japanese to refer to the person, speech, or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship (either in-group or out-group) between the speaker and listener, as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker, listener, and third-person referents.\nMost nouns in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of o- or go- as a prefix. o- is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas go- is affixed to words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as gohan 'cooked rice; meal.' Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item's owner or to the object itself. For example, the word tomodachi 'friend,' would become o-tomodachi when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children's friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to mizu 'water' as o-mizu to show politeness.\n\nVocabulary\nThere are three main sources of words in the Japanese language: the yamato kotoba (\u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449) or wago (\u548c\u8a9e); kango (\u6f22\u8a9e); and gairaigo (\u5916\u6765\u8a9e).\nThe original language of Japan, or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation, was the so-called yamato kotoba (\u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449) or infrequently \u5927\u548c\u8a5e, i.e. \"Yamato words\"), which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as wago (\u548c\u8a9e or rarely \u502d\u8a9e, i.e. the \"Wa language\"). In addition to words from this original language, present-day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from Chinese or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns. These words, known as kango (\u6f22\u8a9e), entered the language from the 5th century onwards by contact with Chinese culture. According to the Shinsen Kokugo Jiten (\u65b0\u9078\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178) Japanese dictionary, kango comprise 49.1% of the total vocabulary, wago make up 33.8%, other foreign words or gairaigo (\u5916\u6765\u8a9e) account for 8.8%, and the remaining 8.3% constitute hybridized words or konshugo (\u6df7\u7a2e\u8a9e) that draw elements from more than one language.\nThere are also a great number of words of mimetic origin in Japanese, with Japanese having a rich collection of sound symbolism, both onomatopoeia for physical sounds, and more abstract words. A small number of words have come into Japanese from the Ainu language. Tonakai (reindeer), rakko (sea otter) and shishamo (smelt, a type of fish) are well-known examples of words of Ainu origin.\nWords of different origins occupy different registers in Japanese. Like Latin-derived words in English, kango words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words. Indeed, it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin/French roots typically corresponds to a Sino-Japanese word in Japanese, whereas an Anglo-Saxon word would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent.\nIncorporating vocabulary from European languages, gairaigo, began with borrowings from Portuguese in the 16th century, followed by words from Dutch during Japan's long isolation of the Edo period. With the Meiji Restoration and the reopening of Japan in the 19th century, words were borrowed from German, French, and English. Today most borrowings are from English.\nIn the Meiji era, the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts; these are known as wasei-kango (Japanese-made Chinese words). Many of these were then imported into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, seiji (\u653f\u6cbb, \"politics\"), and kagaku (\u5316\u5b66, \"chemistry\") are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese, and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages. As a result, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way many Greek- and Latin-derived words \u2013 both inherited or borrowed into European languages, or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots \u2013 are shared among modern European languages \u2013 see classical compound.\nIn the past few decades, wasei-eigo (\"made-in-Japan English\") has become a prominent phenomenon. Words such as wanpat\u0101n \u30ef\u30f3\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3 (< one + pattern, \"to be in a rut\", \"to have a one-track mind\") and sukinshippu \u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u30b7\u30c3\u30d7 (< skin + -ship, \"physical contact\"), although coined by compounding English roots, are nonsensical in most non-Japanese contexts; exceptions exist in nearby languages such as Korean however, which often use words such as skinship and rimokon (remote control) in the same way as in Japanese.\nThe popularity of many Japanese cultural exports has made some native Japanese words familiar in English, including emoji, futon, haiku, judo, kamikaze, karaoke, karate, ninja, origami, rickshaw (from \u4eba\u529b\u8eca jinrikisha), samurai, sayonara, Sudoku, sumo, sushi, tofu, tsunami, tycoon. See list of English words of Japanese origin for more.\n\nGender in the Japanese language\nDepending on the speakers\u2019 gender, different linguistic features might be used. The typical lect used by females is called joseigo (\u5973\u6027\u8a9e) and the one used by males is called danseigo (\u7537\u6027\u8a9e). Joseigo and danseigo are different in various ways, including first-person pronouns (such as watashi or atashi \u79c1 for women and boku (\u50d5) for men) and sentence-final particles (such as wa (\u308f), na no (\u306a\u306e), or kashira (\u304b\u3057\u3089) for joseigo, or zo (\u305e), da (\u3060), or yo (\u3088) for danseigo). In addition to these specific differences, expressions and pitch can also be different. For example, joseigo is more gentle, polite, refined, indirect, modest, and exclamatory, and often accompanied by raised pitch.\n\nKogal slang\nIn the 1990s, the traditional feminine speech patterns and stereotyped behaviors were challenged, and a popular culture of \u201cnaughty\u201d teenage girls emerged, called kogyaru (\u30b3\u30ae\u30e3\u30eb), sometimes referenced in English-language materials as \u201ckogal\u201d. Their rebellious behaviors, deviant language usage, the particular make-up called ganguro (\u30ac\u30f3\u30b0\u30ed), and the fashion became objects of focus in the mainstream media. Although kogal slang was not appreciated by older generations, the kogyaru continued to create terms and expressions. Kogal culture also changed Japanese norms of gender and the Japanese language.\n\nNon-native study\nMany major universities throughout the world provide Japanese language courses, and a number of secondary and even primary schools worldwide offer courses in the language. This is a significant increase from before World War II; in 1940, only 65 Americans not of Japanese descent were able to read, write and understand the language.\nInternational interest in the Japanese language dates from the 19th century but has become more prevalent following Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s and the global popularity of Japanese popular culture (such as anime and video games) since the 1990s. As of 2015, more than 3.6 million people studied the language worldwide, primarily in East and Southeast Asia. Nearly one million Chinese, 745,000 Indonesians, 556,000 South Koreans and 357,000 Australians studied Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions. Between 2012 and 2015, considerable growth of learners originated in Australia (20.5%), Thailand (34.1%), Vietnam (38.7%) and the Philippines (54.4%).\nThe Japanese government provides standardized tests to measure spoken and written comprehension of Japanese for second language learners; the most prominent is the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), which features five levels of exams. The JLPT is offered twice a year.\n\nExample text\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Japanese:\n\nSee also\nAizuchi\nCulture of Japan\nJapanese dictionary\nJapanese exonyms\nJapanese language and computers\nJapanese literature\nJapanese name\nJapanese punctuation\nJapanese profanity\nJapanese Sign Language family\nJapanesepod101.com\nJapanese words and words derived from Japanese in other languages at Wiktionary, Wikipedia's sibling project\nClassical Japanese\nRomanization of Japanese\nHepburn romanization\nRendaku\nYojijukugo\nOther:\nHistory of writing in Vietnam\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nFurther reading\nRudolf Lange, Christopher Noss (1903).

Here is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article on the Japanese language:\n\n### Grammar\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**:\n   - Japanese is a subject-object-verb (SOV) language. The verb must be placed at the end of a sentence.\n   - The basic sentence structure is topic-comment. The topic is marked by the particle \"wa\" (\u306f), and the subject is marked by \"ga\" (\u304c).\n   - Japanese is a topic-prominent language, meaning the topic is often separated from the subject.\n   - Example: \"Tanaka-san wa...\" (\u7530\u4e2d\u3055\u3093\u306f...) indicates \"As for Mr./Ms. Tanaka, ...\".\n\n2. **Particles**:\n   - Particles mark the grammatical function of words. Key particles include:\n     - \"wa\" (\u306f) for the topic.\n     - \"ga\" (\u304c) for the subject.\n     - \"o\" (\u3092) for the object.\n     - \"ni\" (\u306b) for the dative case or direction.\n     - \"no\" (\u306e) for possession or nominalization.\n\n3. **Verb Conjugation**:\n   - Verbs are conjugated for tense (past and non-past) and voice but not for person.\n   - The -te form is used for progressive or perfect aspects, combining verbs, commands, and permissions.\n   - Example: \"taberu\" (\u98df\u3079\u308b, to eat) becomes \"tabemasu\" (\u98df\u3079\u307e\u3059, polite form) and \"tabenai\" (\u98df\u3079\u306a\u3044, negative form).\n\n4. **Adjectives**:\n   - There are three types of adjectives:\n     - **i-adjectives** (\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e keiy\u014dshi): Conjugate for tense and negation. Example: \"atsui\" (\u6691\u3044, hot) becomes \"atsukatta\" (\u6691\u304b\u3063\u305f, was hot).\n     - **na-adjectives** (\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e keiy\u014dd\u014dshi): Followed by \"na\" when modifying nouns. Example: \"hen\" (\u5909, strange) becomes \"hen na hito\" (\u5909\u306a\u4eba, a strange person).\n     - **Rentaishi**: True adjectives that directly modify nouns and do not predicate sentences.\n\n5. **Politeness**:\n   - Japanese has a complex system of politeness, with different levels of speech (teineigo, sonkeigo, kenj\u014dgo) depending on social context.\n   - Honorifics and humble forms are used to show respect or humility.\n\n### Phonology\n\n1. **Vowels**:\n   - Japanese has five vowels, each with a short and long version. Vowel length is phonemic.\n\n2. **Consonants**:\n   - Some consonants have multiple allophones. For example, \"r\" ranges between a tap and a lateral approximant.\n   - The syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C), with optional onset consonants and glides.\n\n3. **Pitch Accent**:\n   - Japanese uses a pitch accent system, which is not represented in writing but affects meaning.\n\n### Writing System\n\n1. **Kanji**:\n   - Chinese characters used for words borrowed from Chinese and native Japanese words.\n   - Kanji are used for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and grammatical elements.\n\n2. **Hiragana**:\n   - A syllabary used for native Japanese words without kanji, grammatical elements, and verb/adjective conjugations (okurigana).\n\n3. **Katakana**:\n   - A syllabary used for foreign words, plant and animal names, and emphasis.\n\n4. **R\u014dmaji**:\n   - The Latin script used for acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names.\n\n5. **Numerals**:\n   - Arabic numerals are common, but kanji numerals are used in compounds.\n\n### Vocabulary\n\n1. **Word Origins**:\n   - **Yamato kotoba**: Native Japanese words.\n   - **Kango**: Words borrowed from Chinese.\n   - **Gairaigo**: Words borrowed from other languages, primarily English.\n\n2. **Sound Symbolism**:\n   - Japanese has a rich collection of onomatopoeia and mimetic words.\n\n3. **Gendered Language**:\n   - Different linguistic features are used based on the speaker's gender, affecting pronouns and sentence-final particles.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Pronouns**: Function more like nouns and can take modifiers. They are used sparingly and often replaced by context.\n- **Beneficiary Auxiliary Verbs**: Indicate the direction of benefit in an action, similar to pronouns and prepositions in other languages.\n- **Non-native Study**: Japanese is widely taught globally, and proficiency tests like the JLPT are available.\n\nThis detailed understanding of Japanese grammar, phonology, writing system, and vocabulary is crucial for accurate translation into Japanese.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:02:02.465907"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_language": {"base_content": "Cherokee or Tsalagi (Cherokee: \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9 \u13a6\u13ec\u13c2\u13af\u13cd\u13d7, romanized: Tsalagi Gawonihisdi, IPA: [d\u0292ala\u02c8\u0261\u00ee \u0261aw\u00f3nihis\u02c8d\u00ee]) is an endangered-to-moribund Iroquoian language and the native language of the Cherokee people. Ethnologue states that there were 1,520 Cherokee speakers out of 376,000 Cherokees in 2018, while a tally by the three Cherokee tribes in 2019 recorded about 2,100 speakers. The number of speakers is in decline. The Tahlequah Daily Press reported in 2019 that most speakers are elderly, about eight fluent speakers die each month, and that only five people under the age of 50 are fluent. The dialect of Cherokee in Oklahoma is \"definitely endangered\", and the one in North Carolina is \"severely endangered\" according to UNESCO. The Lower dialect, formerly spoken on the South Carolina\u2013Georgia border, has been extinct since about 1900. The dire situation regarding the future of the two remaining dialects prompted the Tri-Council of Cherokee tribes to declare a state of emergency in June 2019, with a call to enhance revitalization efforts.\nAround 200 speakers of the Eastern (also referred to as the Middle or Kituwah) dialect remain in North Carolina, and language preservation efforts include the New Kituwah Academy, a bilingual immersion school. The largest remaining group of Cherokee speakers is centered around Tahlequah, Oklahoma, where the Western (Overhill or Otali) dialect predominates. The Cherokee Immersion School (Tsalagi Tsunadeloquasdi) in Tahlequah serves children in federally recognized tribes from pre-school up to grade 6.\nCherokee, a polysynthetic language, is also the only member of the Southern Iroquoian family, and it uses a unique syllabary writing system. As a polysynthetic language, Cherokee differs dramatically from Indo-European languages such as English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese, and as such can be difficult for adult learners to acquire. A single Cherokee word can convey ideas that would require multiple English words to express, from the context of the assertion and connotations about the speaker to the idea's action and its object. The morphological complexity of the Cherokee language is best exhibited in verbs, which comprise approximately 75% of the language, as opposed to only 25% of the English language. Verbs must contain at minimum a pronominal prefix, a verb root, an aspect suffix, and a modal suffix.\nExtensive documentation of the language exists, as it is the indigenous language of North America in which the most literature has been published. Such publications include a Cherokee dictionary and grammar, as well as several editions of the New Testament and Psalms of the Bible and the Cherokee Phoenix (\u13e3\u13b3\u13a9 \u13e7\u13b4\u13af\u13cc\u13c5\u13af, Tsalagi Tsulehisanvhi), the first newspaper published by Native Americans in the United States and the first published in a Native American language.\n\nClassification\nCherokee is an Iroquoian language, and the only Southern Iroquoian language spoken today. Linguists believe that the Cherokee people migrated to the southeast from the Great Lakes region about three thousand years ago, bringing with them their language. Despite the three-thousand-year geographic separation, the Cherokee language today still shows some similarities to the languages spoken around the Great Lakes, such as Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora.\nSome researchers (such as Thomas Whyte) have suggested the homeland of the proto-Iroquoian language resides in Appalachia. Whyte contends, based on linguistic and molecular studies, that proto-Iroquoian speakers participated in cultural and economic exchanges along the north\u2013south axis of the Appalachian Mountains. The divergence of Southern Iroquoian (which Cherokee is the only known branch of) from the Northern Iroquoian languages occurred approximately 4,000\u20133,000 years ago as Late Archaic proto-Iroquoian speaking peoples became more sedentary with the advent of horticulture, advancement of lithic technologies and the emergence of social complexity in the Eastern Woodlands. In the subsequent millennia, the Northern Iroquoian and Southern Iroquoian would be separated by various Algonquin and Siouan speaking peoples as linguistic, religious, social and technological practices from the Algonquin to the north and east and the Siouans to the west from the Ohio Valley would come to be practiced by peoples in the Chesapeake region, as well as parts of the Carolinas.\n\nHistory\nLiteracy\nBefore the development of the Cherokee syllabary in the 1820s, Cherokee was an oral language only. The Cherokee syllabary is a set of written symbols invented by Sequoyah in the late 1810s and early 1820s to write the Cherokee language. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy in that he could not previously read any script. Sequoyah had some contact with English literacy and the Roman alphabet through his proximity to Fort Loudoun, where he engaged in trade with Europeans. He was exposed to English literacy through his white father. His limited understanding of the Latin alphabet, including the ability to recognize the letters of his name, may have aided him in the creation of the Cherokee syllabary. When developing the written language, Sequoyah first experimented with logograms, but his system later developed into a syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme; the 85 (originally 86) characters in the Cherokee syllabary provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Some typeface syllables do resemble the Latin, Greek, and even the Cyrillic scripts' letters, but the sounds are completely different (for example, the sound /a/ is written with a letter that resembles Latin D).\nAround 1809, Sequoyah began work to create a system of writing for the Cherokee language. At first he sought to create a character for each word in the language. He spent a year on this effort, leaving his fields unplanted, so that his friends and neighbors thought he had lost his mind. His wife is said to have burned his initial work, believing it to be witchcraft. He finally realized that this approach was impractical because it would require too many pictures to be remembered. He then tried making a symbol for every idea, but this also caused too many problems to be practical.\nSequoyah did not succeed until he gave up trying to represent entire words and developed a written symbol for each syllable in the language. After approximately a month, he had a system of 86 characters. \"In their present form [of typeface syllabary, not the original handwritten syllabary], many of the syllabary characters resemble Roman, Cyrillic, or Greek letters, or Arabic numerals,\" says Janine Scancarelli, a scholar of Cherokee writing, \"but there is no apparent relationship between their sounds in other languages and in Cherokee.\"\nUnable to find adults willing to learn the syllabary, he taught it to his daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka). Langguth says she was only six years old at the time. He traveled to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansas Territory where some Cherokees had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him, believing that the symbols were merely ad hoc reminders. Sequoyah asked each to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokees that he had created a practical writing system.\nWhen Sequoyah returned east, he brought a sealed envelope containing a written speech from one of the Arkansas Cherokee leaders. By reading this speech, he convinced the eastern Cherokees also to learn the system, after which it spread rapidly. In 1825 the Cherokee Nation officially adopted the writing system. From 1828 to 1834, American missionaries assisted the Cherokees in using Sequoyah's original syllabary to develop typeface syllabary characters and print the Cherokee Phoenix, the first newspaper of the Cherokee Nation, with text in both Cherokee and English.\nIn 1826, the Cherokee National Council commissioned George Lowrey and David Brown to translate and print eight copies of the laws of the Cherokee Nation in the new Cherokee language typeface using Sequoyah's system, but not his original self-created handwritten syllable glyphs.\nOnce Albert Gallatin saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he found the syllabary superior to the English alphabet. Even though a Cherokee student must learn 86 syllables instead of 26 letters, they can read immediately. Students could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing could learn in two years.\nIn 1824, the General Council of the Eastern Cherokees awarded Sequoyah a large silver medal in honor of the syllabary. According to Davis, one side of the medal bore his image surrounded by the inscription in English, \"Presented to George Gist by the General Council of the Cherokee for his ingenuity in the invention of the Cherokee Alphabet.\" The reverse side showed two long-stemmed pipes and the same inscription written in Cherokee. Supposedly, Sequoyah wore the medal throughout the rest of his life, and it was buried with him.\nBy 1825, the Bible and numerous religious hymns and pamphlets, educational materials, legal documents, and books were translated into the Cherokee language. Thousands of Cherokees became literate and the literacy rate for Cherokees in the original syllabary, as well as the typefaced syllabary, was higher in the Cherokee Nation than that of literacy of whites in the English alphabet in the United States.\nThough use of the Cherokee syllabary declined after many of the Cherokees were forcibly removed to Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma, it has survived in private correspondence, renderings of the Bible, and descriptions of Indian medicine and now can be found in books and on the internet among other places.\nIn February 2022, Motorola Mobility introduced a Cherokee language interface for its latest smartphone. Eastern Band Principal Chief Richard Sneed, who along with other Cherokee leaders worked with Motorola on the development, considered this an effort to preserve the language. Features included not only symbols but also the culture.\n\nGeographic distribution\nThe language remains concentrated in some Oklahoma communities and communities like Big Cove and Snowbird in North Carolina.\n\nDialects\nAt the time of European contact, there were three major dialects of Cherokee: Lower, Middle, and Overhill. The Lower dialect, formerly spoken on the South Carolina-Georgia border, has been extinct since about 1900. Of the remaining two dialects, the Middle dialect (Kituwah) is spoken by the Eastern Band on the Qualla Boundary, and retains ~200 speakers. The Overhill, or Western, dialect is spoken in eastern Oklahoma and by the Snowbird Community in North Carolina by ~1,300 people. The Western dialect is most widely used and is considered the main dialect of the language. Both dialects have had English influence, with the Overhill, or Western dialect showing some Spanish influence as well.\nThe now extinct Lower dialect spoken by the inhabitants of the Lower Towns in the vicinity of the South Carolina\u2013Georgia border had r as the liquid consonant in its inventory, while both the contemporary Kituhwa dialect spoken in North Carolina and the Overhill dialect contain l.\n\nLanguage drift\nThere are two main dialects of Cherokee spoken by modern speakers. The Giduwa (or Kituwah) dialect (Eastern Band) and the Otali dialect (also called the Overhill dialect) spoken in Oklahoma. The Otali dialect has drifted significantly from Sequoyah's syllabary in the past 150 years, and many contracted and borrowed words have been adopted into the language. These noun and verb roots in Cherokee, however, can still be mapped to Sequoyah's syllabary. There are more than 85 syllables in use by modern Cherokee speakers.\n\nStatus and preservation efforts\nIn 2019, the Tri-Council of Cherokee tribes declared a state of emergency for the language due to the threat of it going extinct, calling for the enhancement of revitalization programs. The language retains about 1,500 to 2,100 Cherokee speakers, but an average of eight fluent speakers die each month, and only a handful of people under 40 years of age are fluent as of 2019. In 1986, the literacy rate for first language speakers was 15\u201320% who could read and 5% who could write, according to the 1986 Cherokee Heritage Center. A 2005 survey determined that the Eastern Band had 460 fluent speakers. Ten years later, the number was believed to be 200.\n\nCherokee is \"definitely endangered\" in Oklahoma and \"severely endangered\" in North Carolina according to UNESCO. Cherokee has been the co-official language of the Cherokee Nation alongside English since a 1991 legislation officially proclaimed this under the Act Relating to the Tribal Policy for the Promotion and Preservation of Cherokee Language, History, and Culture. Cherokee is also recognized as the official language of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. As Cherokee is official, the entire constitution of the United Keetoowah Band is available in both English and Cherokee. As an official language, any tribal member may communicate with the tribal government in Cherokee or English, English translation services are provided for Cherokee speakers, and both Cherokee and English are used when the tribe provides services, resources, and information to tribal members or when communicating with the tribal council. The 1991 legislation allows the political branch of the nation to maintain Cherokee as a living language. Because they are within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area, hospitals and health centers such as the Three Rivers Health Center in Muscogee, Oklahoma provide Cherokee language translation services.\n\nEducation\nIn 2008 the Cherokee Nation initiated a ten-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs, as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80 percent or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $4.5 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. They have accomplished: \"Curriculum development, teaching materials and teacher training for a total immersion program for children, beginning when they are preschoolers, that enables them to learn Cherokee as their first language. The participating children and their parents learn to speak and read together. The Tribe operates the Kituwah Academy\". Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.\nThere is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade.  A second campus was added in November 2021, when the school purchased Greasy School in Greasy, Oklahoma, located in southern Adair County ten miles south of Stilwell.  Situated in the largest area of Cherokee speakers in the world, the opportunity for that campus is for students to spend the day in an immersion school and then return to a Cherokee-speaking home.\nSeveral universities offer Cherokee as a second language, including the University of Oklahoma, Northeastern State University, and Western Carolina University. Western Carolina University (WCU) has partnered with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) to promote and restore the language through the school's Cherokee Studies program, which offers classes in and about the language and culture of the Cherokee Indians. WCU and the EBCI have initiated a ten-year language revitalization plan consisting of: (1) a continuation of the improvement and expansion of the EBCI Atse Kituwah Cherokee Language Immersion School, (2) continued development of Cherokee language learning resources, and (3) building of Western Carolina University programs to offer a more comprehensive language training curriculum.\nIn November 2022, the tribe opened a $20 million language center in a 52,000-square-foot building near its headquarters in Tahlequah.  The immersion facility, which has classes for youth to adults, features no English signage: even the exit signs feature a pictograph of a person running for the door rather than the English word.\nThe Cherokee Nation has created language lessons on the online learning platform Memrise which contain \"around 1,000 Cherokee words and phrases\".\n\nPhonology\nThe family of Iroquoian languages has a unique phonological inventory. Unlike most languages, the Cherokee inventory of consonants lacks the labial sounds /p/ and /b/. It also lacks /f/ and /v/. Cherokee does, however, have one labial consonant, /m/, but it is rare, appearing in no more than ten native words. In fact, the Lower dialect does not produce /m/ at all. Instead, it uses /w/.\nIn the case of /p/, \u27e8qw\u27e9 /k\u02b7/ is often substituted, as in the name of the Cherokee Wikipedia, Wigiqwediya. Some words may contain sounds not reflected in the given phonology: for instance, the modern Oklahoma use of the loanword \"automobile\", with the /\u0254/ and /b/ sounds of English.\n\nConsonants\nAs with many Iroquoian languages, Cherokee's phonemic inventory is small. The consonants for North Carolina Cherokee are given in the table below. The consonants of all Iroquoian languages pattern so that they may be grouped as (oral) obstruents, sibilants, laryngeals, and resonants.:\u200a337\n\nNotes\nThe stops /t, k, k\u02b7/ and affricates /t\u0361s, t\u0361\u026c/ are voiced in the beginning of syllables and between vowels: [d, \u0261, \u0261\u02b7, d\u0361z, d\u0361\u026e]. Before /h/, they surface as aspirated stops: [t\u02b0, k\u02b0, k\u02b7\u02b0, t\u0361s\u02b0], except /t\u0361\u026c/ which surfaces as a plain voiceless affricate [t\u0361\u026c] or fricative [\u026c] in some Oklahoma Cherokee speakers. These aspirated allophones are felt as separate phonemes by native speakers and are often reflected as such in the orthographies (in romanization or syllabary).\n/t\u0361s/ is palatalized as [t\u0361\u0255 \u2053 t\u0361\u0283] (voiced allophones: [d\u0361\u0291 \u2053 d\u0361\u0292]) in the Oklahoma dialects, but [t\u0361s] before /h/ + obstruent after vowel deletion: j\u2c65-hdlv\u0301vga becomes tsdlv\u0301vga 'you are sick'.\n/t\u0361\u026c/ has merged with /t\u0361s/ in most North Carolina dialects.\n[\u0261] (the voiced allophone of /k/) can also be lenited to [\u0263], and [\u0261\u02b7] (the voiced allophone of /k\u02b7/) to [\u0263\u02b7 \u2053 w].\nThe sonorants /n, l, j, \u0270/ are devoiced when preceding or following /h/, with varying degrees of allophony: [n\u0325, l\u0325\u2053\u026c, j\u0325\u2053\u00e7, w\u0325\u2053\u028d\u2053\u0278].\n/m/ is the only true labial. It occurs only in a dozen native words and is not reconstructed for Proto-Iroquoian.\n/s/ is realized as [\u0283] or even [\u0282] in North Carolina dialects. After a short vowel, /s/ is always preceded by a faint /h/, generally not spelled in the romanized orthographies.\n/\u0294/ and /h/, including the pre-aspiration /h/ mentioned above, participate in complex rules of laryngeal and tonal alternations, often surfacing as various tones instead. Ex: h-vhd-a > hvhda \"use it!\" but g-vhd-\u00edha >  gvv\u0300d\u00edha \"I am using it\" with a low falling tone; wi-hi-gaht-i > hwikti \"you're heading there\" but wi-ji-gaht-i >  wijig\u00e1ati \"I am heading there\" with a falling tone.\n\nOrthography\nThere are two main competing orthographies, depending on how plain and aspirated stops (including affricates) are represented:\n\nIn the d/t system, plain stops are represented by English voiced stops (d, g, gw, j, dl) and aspirated stops by English voiceless stops (t, k, kw, c, tl). This orthography is favored by native speakers.\nIn the t/th system, plain stops are represented by voiceless stops instead, and aspirated stops by sequences of voiceless stops + h (th, kh, khw/kwh, ch, thl/tlh). This orthography is favored by linguists.\nAnother orthography, used in Holmes (1977), doesn't distinguish plain stops from aspirated stops for /t\u0361sa/ and /kw/ and uses ts and qu for both modes. Spellings working from the syllabary rather than from the sounds often behave similarly, /t\u0361s/ and /k\u02b7/ being the only two stop series not having separate letters for plain and aspirated before any vowel in Sequoyah script. Ex: \u13cc\u13ca saquu [sa\u00e0\u0261\u02b7u], \u13c6\u13be quana [k\u02b7\u02b0ana].\n\nVowels\nThere are six short vowels and six long vowels in the Cherokee inventory. As with all Iroquoian languages, this includes a nasalized vowel.:\u200a337\u200a In the case of Cherokee, the nasalized vowel is a mid central vowel usually represented as v and is pronounced [\u0259\u0303], that is as a schwa vowel like the unstressed \"a\" in the English word \"comma\" plus the nasalization. It is similar to the nasalized vowel in the French word un which means \"one\".\n\n/u/ is weakly rounded and often realized as [\u026f \u2053 \u0289].\nWord-final vowels are short and nasalized, and receive an automatic high or high-falling tone: wado [wad\u1e4d] 'thank you'. They are often dropped in casual speech: ga\u00e1da [\u0261a\u00e1t\u02b0] 'dirt'. When deletion happens, trailing /\u0294/ and /h/ are also deleted and any resulting long vowel is further shortened: u\u00f9goohvv\u0301\u0294i becomes u\u00f9goohv\u0301 'he saw it'.\nShort vowels are devoiced before /h/: digad\u00f3hdi [di\u0261ad\u00f3\u0325hd\u0129\u0301]. But due to the phonological rules of vowel deletion, laryngeal metathesis and laryngeal alternation (see below), this environment is relatively rare.\nSequences of two non-identical vowels are disallowed and the vowel clash must be resolved. There are four strategies depending on the phonological and morphological environments:\n\nthe first vowel is kept: u\u00f9-aduul\u00edha becomes u\u00f9duul\u00edha 'he wants',\nthe second vowel is kept: hi-\u00e9\u00e9ga becomes h\u00e9\u00e9ga 'you're going',\nan epenthetic consonant is inserted: jii-uudal\u00e9\u00e9\u0294a becomes jiiyuudal\u00e9\u00e9\u0294a,\nthey merge into a different vowel or tone quality.\nThese make the identification of each individual morpheme often a difficult task:\n\nTone\nCherokee distinguishes six pitch patterns or tones, using four pitch levels. Two tones are level (low, high) and appear on short or long vowels. The other four are contour tones (rising, falling, lowfall, highrise) and appear on long vowels only.\nThere is no academic consensus on the notation of tone and length, although in 2011 a project began to document the use of tones in Cherokee to improve language instruction. Below are the main conventions, along with the standardized IPA notation.\n\nThe low tone is the default, unmarked tone.\nThe high tone is the marked tone. Some sources of high tone apply to the mora, others to the syllable. Complex morphophonological rules govern whether it can spread one mora to the left, to the right or at all. It has both lexical and morphological functions.\nThe rising and falling tones are secondary tones, i.e. combinations of low and high tones, deriving from moraic high tones and from high tone spread.\nThe lowfall tone mainly derives from glottal stop deletion after a long vowel, but also has important morphological functions (pronominal lowering, tonic/atonic alternation, laryngeal alternation).\nThe superhigh tone, also called highfall by Montgomery-Anderson, has a distinctive morphosyntactical function, primarily appearing on adjectives, nouns derived from verbs, and on subordinate verbs. It is mobile and falls on the rightmost long vowel. If the final short vowel is dropped and the superhigh tone becomes in word-final position, it is shortened and pronounced like a slightly higher final tone (notated as a\u030b in most orthographies). There can only be one superhigh tone per word, constraint not shared by the other tones. For these reasons, this contour exhibits some accentual properties and has been referred to as an accent (or stress) in the literature.\nWhile the tonal system is undergoing a gradual simplification in many areas, it remains important in meaning and is still held strongly by many, especially older, speakers. The syllabary displays neither tone nor vowel length, but as stated earlier regarding the paucity of minimal pairs, real cases of ambiguity are rare. The same goes for transliterated Cherokee (osiyo for [oos\u00edjo], dohitsu for [do\u00f2hi\u0131\u030bd\u0292u], etc.), which is rarely written with any tone markers, except in dictionaries. Native speakers can tell the difference between written words based solely on context.\n\nGrammar\nCherokee, like many Native American languages, is polysynthetic, meaning that many morphemes may be linked together to form a single word, which may be of great length. Cherokee verbs must contain at a minimum a pronominal prefix, a verb root, an aspect suffix, and a modal suffix, for a total of 17 verb tenses. They can also bear prepronominal prefixes, reflexive prefixes, and derivational suffixes. Given all possible combinations of affixes, each regular verb can have 21,262 inflected forms.\nFor example, the verb form g\u00e9\u00e9ga, 'I am going', has each of these elements:\n\nThe pronominal prefix is g-, which indicates first person singular. The verb root is -\u00e9\u00e9-, 'to go.' The aspect suffix that this verb employs for the present-tense stem is -g-. The present-tense modal suffix for regular verbs in Cherokee is -a.\nCherokee makes three number distinctions on pronouns: singular, dual and plural. It does not make gender distinction, but does distinguish animacy in third person pronouns. Cherokee also makes the distinction between inclusive and exclusive pronouns in the first person dual and plural. There is no distinction between dual and plural in the 3rd person. This makes a total of 10 persons.\nThe following is the conjugation of this verb form in all 10 persons.\n\nThe translation uses the present progressive ('at this time I am going'). Cherokee differentiates between progressive ('I am going') and habitual ('I go') more than English does. For the habitual, the aspectual prefix is -g- \"imperfective\" or \"incompletive\" (here identical to present, but can vary for other verbs) and the modal prefix -\u00f3\u00f3\u02bci \"habitual\".\n\nPronouns and pronominal prefixes\nLike many Native American languages, Cherokee has many pronominal prefixes that can index both subject and object. Pronominal prefixes always appear on verbs and can also appear on adjectives and nouns. There are two separate words which function as pronouns: aya 'I, me' and nihi 'you'.\n\nCompound pronouns\nA Cherokee pronoun's number marks not only the agent of a verb, but often the object as well. This is the case if the depending object was already mentioned and would be substituted by a separate pronoun in English as well. Contrary to English, animacy is marked but gender is not.\n(These suffixes have to be treated in a CV syllabary structure.) Set I and II join here except if written A | B.\n\nSome prefixes are the same, even though they mean their opposite. Understanding is ensured by regular stem changes within the verb.\n\nShape classifiers in verbs\nSome Cherokee verbs require special classifiers which denote a physical property of the direct object. Only around 20 common verbs require one of these classifiers (such as the equivalent of 'hold'). The classifiers can be grouped into five categories:\n\nLive\nFlexible (most common)\nLong (narrow, not flexible)\nIndefinite (solid, heavy relative to size), also used as default category\nLiquid (or container of)\nExample:\n\nThere have been reports that the youngest speakers of Cherokee are using only the indefinite forms, suggesting a decline in usage or full acquisition of the system of shape classification. Cherokee is the only Iroquoian language with this type of classificatory verb system, leading linguists to reanalyze it as a potential remnant of a noun incorporation system in Proto-Iroquoian. However, given the non-productive nature of noun incorporation in Cherokee, other linguists have suggested that classificatory verbs are the product of historical contact between Cherokee and non-Iroquoian languages, and instead that the noun incorporation system in Northern Iroquoian languages developed later.\n\nWord order\nAll orderings between subjects, verbs, and objects are possible in Cherokee sentences, but word order preferences are influenced by a number of factors. Some preferences are determined by information structure; items that express contrast with alternatives generally precede other arguments, and items that express new information typically precede those that refer to entities already in the conversation. Word order is also influenced by thematic role, such that agent arguments of transitive sentences (subjects) typically precede theme arguments (objects). Verbs typically occur either at the end of the sentence or followed by exactly one phrase; it is highly uncommon to find two phrases following the verb in a single sentence. In copular sentences, the subject complement must precede the copular verb. Negative sentences have a different word order.\nWithin the nominal expression, some relative orders are fixed, while others are flexible. Demonstratives, such as \u13be\u13cd\u13a9 nasgi ('that') or \u13af\u13a0 hia ('this'), occur at the beginning of noun phrases. Numerals follow demonstratives, and precede both nouns and adjectives. Adjectives may either precede or follow nouns. Relative clauses follow the nouns that they modify. Adverbs precede the verbs that they are modifying. For example, 'she's speaking loudly' is \u13a0\u13cd\u13d3\u13ef \u13a6\u13ec\u13c2\u13ad asdaya gawoniha (literally, 'loud she's-speaking').\nIn affirmative present tense sentences, no verb is required to express a copular, predicative relationship between two noun phrases. In such a case, word order is flexible. For example, \u13be \u13a0\u13cd\u13a6\u13ef \u13a0\u13a9\u13d9\u13d3 na asgaya agidoda ('that man is my father'). Adjectives can also be used predicatively with a noun phrase subject, as in \u13a0\u13a9\u13d9\u13d3 \u13a4\u13d4\u13be agidoda utana ('my father is big').\n\nOrthography\nCherokee is written in an 85-character syllabary invented by Sequoyah (also known as Guest or George Gist). Many of the letters resemble the Latin letters they derive from, but have completely unrelated sound values; Sequoyah had seen English, Hebrew, and Greek writing but did not know how to read them.\nTwo other scripts used to write Cherokee are a simple Latin transliteration and a more precise system with Diacritical marks.\n\nDescription\nEach of the characters represents one syllable, as in the Japanese kana and the Bronze Age Greek Linear B writing systems. The first six characters represent isolated vowel syllables. Characters for combined consonant and vowel syllables then follow. It is recited from left to right, top to bottom.\nThe charts below show the syllabary as arranged by Samuel Worcester along with his commonly used transliterations. He played a key role in the development of Cherokee printing from 1828 until his death in 1859.\n\nNotes\nIn the chart, 'v' represents a nasal vowel, /\u0259\u0303/.\nThe character \u13d9 do is shown upside-down in some fonts.\nThe transliteration working from the syllabary uses conventional consonants like qu and ts, and may differ from the ones used in the phonological orthographies (first column in the below chart, in the d/t system).\n\nThe phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others often represent different forms of the same syllable.  Not all phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are represented:\n\nAspirated consonants are generally not distinguished from their plain counterpart. For example, while /d/ + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from /t/ + vowel by use of different glyphs, syllables beginning with /\u0261w/ are all conflated with those beginning with /kw/.\nLong vowels are not distinguished from short vowels. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon, and other disambiguation methods for consonants (somewhat like the Japanese dakuten) have been suggested.\nTones are not marked.\nSyllables ending in vowels, h, or glottal stop are undifferentiated.  For example, the single symbol \u13d1 is used to represent both su\u00fa as in su\u00fad\u00e1li, meaning 'six' (\u13d1\u13d3\u13b5), and s\u00fah as in s\u00fahdi, meaning 'fishhook' (\u13d1\u13d7).\nThere is no regular rule for representing consonant clusters. When consonants other than s, h, or glottal stop arise in clusters with other consonants, a vowel must be inserted, chosen either arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel, see vowel deletion for instance). For example, \u13e7\u13be\u13cd\u13d7 (tsu-na-s-di) represents the word juunsdi\u030b, meaning 'small (pl.), babies'. The consonant cluster ns is broken down by insertion of the vowel a, and is spelled as \u13be\u13cd /nas/. The vowel is etymological as juunsdi\u030b is composed of the morphemes di-uunii-asdii\u030b\u0294i (), where a is part of the root. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced.\nAs with some other underspecified writing systems, such as Arabic, adult speakers can distinguish words by context.\n\nUnicode\nCherokee was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\nBlocks\nThe main Unicode block for Cherokee is U+13A0\u2013U+13FF. It contains the script's upper-case syllables as well as six lower-case syllables:\n\nThe rest of the lower-case syllables are encoded at U+AB70\u2013ABBF:\n\nFonts and digital platform support\nA single Cherokee Unicode font, Plantagenet Cherokee, is supplied with macOS, version 10.3 (Panther) and later. Windows Vista also includes a Cherokee font. Several free Cherokee fonts are available including Digohweli, Donisiladv, and Noto Sans Cherokee. Some pan-Unicode fonts, such as Code2000, Everson Mono, and GNU FreeFont, include Cherokee characters. A commercial font, Phoreus Cherokee, published by TypeCulture, includes multiple weights and styles. The Cherokee Nation Language Technology Program supports \"innovative solutions for the Cherokee language on all digital platforms including smartphones, laptops, desktops, tablets and social networks.\"\n\nVocabulary\nNumbers\nCherokee uses Arabic numerals (0\u20139).  The Cherokee council voted not to adopt Sequoyah's numbering system. Sequoyah created individual symbols for 1\u201320, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 as well as a symbol for three zeros for numbers in the thousands, and a symbol for six zeros for numbers in the millions.  These last two symbols, representing \",000\" and \",000,000\", are made up of two separate symbols each.  They have a symbol in common, which could be used as a zero in itself.\n\nDays\nMonths\nColors\nWord creation\nThe polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language enables the language to develop new descriptive words in Cherokee to reflect or express new concepts. Some good examples are \u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af (ditiyohihi, 'he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose') corresponding to 'attorney' and \u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9 (didaniyisgi, 'the final catcher' or 'he catches them finally and conclusively') for 'policeman'.\nOther words have been adopted from another language such as the English word gasoline, which in Cherokee is \u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1 (gasoline). Other words were adopted from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 1900s.  One interesting and humorous example is the name of Nowata, Oklahoma, deriving from nowata, a Delaware word for 'welcome' (more precisely the Delaware word is nuwita which can mean 'welcome' or 'friend' in the Delaware languages). The white settlers of the area used the name Nowata for the township, and local Cherokee, being unaware that the word had its origins in the Delaware language, called the town \u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be (Amadikanigvnagvna) which means 'the water is all gone gone from here' \u2014 i.e. 'no water'.\nOther examples of adopted words are \u13a7\u13eb (kawi) for 'coffee' and \u13e9\u13e5 (watsi) for 'watch'; which led to \u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5 (utana watsi, 'big watch') for clock.\nMeaning expansion can be illustrated by the words for 'warm' and 'cold', which can be also extended to mean 'south' and 'north'.  Around the time of the American Civil War, they were further extended to US party labels, Democratic and Republican, respectively.\n\nSamples\nFrom the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAkku\u015f, F.

Below is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article:\n\n### Phonology\n- **Consonants**: Cherokee lacks labial sounds like /p/ and /b/, and also lacks /f/ and /v/. It has one labial consonant, /m/, which is rare. The stops /t, k, k\u02b7/ and affricates /t\u0361s, t\u0361\u026c/ are voiced in the beginning of syllables and between vowels. Before /h/, they surface as aspirated stops. The sonorants /n, l, j, \u0270/ are devoiced when preceding or following /h/.\n- **Vowels**: Cherokee has six short vowels and six long vowels, including a nasalized vowel represented as /\u0259\u0303/. Word-final vowels are short and nasalized, often receiving an automatic high or high-falling tone. Sequences of two non-identical vowels are disallowed, and vowel clash must be resolved through various strategies.\n\n### Tone\n- Cherokee distinguishes six pitch patterns or tones using four pitch levels: low, high, rising, falling, lowfall, and highrise. The tonal system is crucial for meaning and is still strongly held by many speakers.\n\n### Grammar\n- **Polysynthetic Nature**: Cherokee is polysynthetic, meaning many morphemes can be linked to form a single word. Verbs must contain a pronominal prefix, a verb root, an aspect suffix, and a modal suffix, with a total of 17 verb tenses.\n- **Verb Conjugation**: For example, the verb form g\u00e9\u00e9ga ('I am going') includes:\n  - Pronominal prefix: g- (first person singular)\n  - Verb root: -\u00e9\u00e9- ('to go')\n  - Aspect suffix: -g- (present-tense stem)\n  - Modal suffix: -a (present-tense modal suffix)\n- **Pronouns**: Cherokee makes three number distinctions (singular, dual, plural) and distinguishes animacy in third person pronouns. It also differentiates between inclusive and exclusive pronouns in the first person dual and plural.\n- **Shape Classifiers**: Some verbs require classifiers denoting a physical property of the direct object, grouped into categories like live, flexible, long, indefinite, and liquid.\n\n### Orthography\n- **Syllabary**: Cherokee is written in an 85-character syllabary invented by Sequoyah. Each character represents a syllable. The syllabary does not distinguish aspirated consonants from their plain counterparts, nor does it mark long vowels or tones.\n- **Competing Orthographies**: There are two main orthographies: the d/t system (favored by native speakers) and the t/th system (favored by linguists).\n\n### Vocabulary\n- **Word Creation**: The polysynthetic nature allows for the development of new descriptive words. Some words are adopted from other languages, while others are created to express new concepts.\n- **Numbers and Days**: Cherokee uses Arabic numerals and has specific words for days and months.\n\n### Translation Resources\n- **Online Tools**: Cherokee-English Dictionary Online Database, Cherokee word list lookup, and Cherokee Unicode Chart are available for translators.\n- **Language Lessons**: Free online Cherokee classes and downloadable flashcard decks can aid in learning the language.\n\nUnderstanding these elements is crucial for accurately translating text into Cherokee, as they provide the necessary framework for constructing sentences, conjugating verbs, and using the correct orthography.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:02:21.391755"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_syllabary": {"base_content": "The Cherokee syllabary is a syllabary invented by Sequoyah in the late 1810s and early 1820s to write the Cherokee language. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy as he was illiterate until its creation. He first experimented with logograms, but his system later developed into the syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme; the 85 (originally 86) characters provide a suitable method for writing Cherokee. The letters resemble characters from other scripts, such as Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Glagolitic, but are not used to represent the same sounds.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nAround 1809, impressed by the \"talking leaves\" of European written languages, Sequoyah began work to create a writing system for the Cherokee language. After attempting to create a character for each word, Sequoyah realized this would be too difficult and eventually created characters to represent syllables. He worked on the syllabary for twelve years before completion and dropped or modified most of the characters he originally created.\nAfter the syllabary was completed in the early 1820s, it achieved almost instantaneous popularity and spread rapidly throughout Cherokee society. By 1825, the majority of Cherokees could read and write in their newly developed orthography.\nSome of Sequoyah's most learned contemporaries immediately understood that the syllabary was a great invention. For example, when Albert Gallatin, a politician and trained linguist, saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he believed it was superior to the English alphabet in that literacy could be easily achieved for Cherokee at a time when only one-third of English-speaking people achieved the same goal. He recognized that even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26 for English, the Cherokee could read immediately after learning all the symbols. The Cherokee student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing might require two years to achieve.\nIn 1828, the order of the characters in a chart and the shapes of the characters were modified by Cherokee author and editor Elias Boudinot to adapt the syllabary to printing presses. The 86th character was dropped entirely. Following these changes, the syllabary was adopted by the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper, later Cherokee Advocate, followed by the Cherokee Messenger, a bilingual paper printed in Indian Territory in the mid-19th century.\nIn 1834, Worcester made changes to several characters in order to improve the readability of Cherokee text. Most notably, he inverted the do character (\u13d9) so that it could not be confused with the go character (\u13aa). Otherwise, the characters remained remarkably invariant until the advent of new typesetting technologies in the 20th century.\n\nLater developments\nIn the 1960s, the Cherokee Phoenix Press began publishing literature in the Cherokee syllabary, including the Cherokee Singing Book. A Cherokee syllabary typewriter ball was developed for the IBM Selectric in the late 1970s. Computer fonts greatly expanded Cherokee writers' ability to publish in Cherokee. In 2010, a Cherokee keyboard cover was developed by Roy Boney, Jr. and Joseph Erb, facilitating more rapid typing in Cherokee. The keyboard cover is now used by students in the Cherokee Nation Immersion School, where all coursework is written in syllabary.\nIn August 2010, the Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts in Cherokee, North Carolina, acquired a letterpress and had the Cherokee syllabary recast to begin printing one-of-a-kind fine art books and prints in syllabary. Artists Jeff Marley and Frank Brannon completed a collaborative project on October 19, 2013, in which they printed using Cherokee syllabary type from Southwestern Community College in the print shop at New Echota. This was the first time syllabary type has been used at New Echota since 1835.\nThe syllabary is finding increasingly diverse usage today, from books, newspapers, and websites to the street signs of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and Cherokee, North Carolina. An increasing corpus of children's literature is printed in Cherokee to meet the needs of students in Cherokee language immersion schools in Oklahoma and North Carolina.\n\nPossible influence on Liberian Vai syllabary\nIn the 1960s, evidence emerged suggesting that the Cherokee syllabary of North America provided a model for the design of the Vai syllabary in Liberia. The Vai syllabary emerged about 1832/33. This was at a time when American missionaries were working to use the Cherokee syllabary as a model for writing Liberian languages. Another link appears to have been Cherokee who emigrated to Liberia after the invention of the Cherokee syllabary (which in its early years spread rapidly among the Cherokee) but before the inventions of the Vai syllabary. One such man, Austin Curtis, married into a prominent Vai family and became an important Vai chief himself. It is perhaps not coincidence that the \"inscription on a house\" that drew the world's attention to the existence of the Vai script was in fact on the home of Curtis, a Cherokee.  There also appears to be a connection between an early form of written Bassa and the earlier Cherokee syllabary.\n\nDescription\nThe modern writing system consists of 85 characters, each representing a distinct syllable. The first six characters represent isolated vowel syllables. Characters for combined consonant and vowel syllables then follow.\nThe charts below show the syllabary in recitation order, left to right, top to bottom as arranged by Samuel Worcester, along with his commonly used transliterations. He played a key role in the development of Cherokee printing from 1828 until his death in 1859.  The Latin letter 'v' in the transcriptions, seen in the last column, represents the nasal mid-central vowel, /\u0259\u0303/.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe Cherokee character \u13d9 (do) has a different orientation in old documents, an upside-down letter V, flipped as compared to modern documents.\nThere is also a handwritten cursive form of the syllabary; notably, the handwritten glyphs bear little resemblance to the printed forms.\n\nDetailed considerations\nThe phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others may represent multiple variations of the same syllable. Not all phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are represented:\n\nVoiced consonants are generally not distinguished from their non-voiced counterpart. For example, while /d/ + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from /t/ + vowel by use of different glyphs, syllables beginning with /\u0261w/ are all conflated with those beginning with /kw/.\nLong vowels are not distinguished from short vowels. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon, and other disambiguation methods for consonants have been suggested.\nSyllables ending in vowels, h, or a glottal stop are not differentiated. For example, the single symbol \u13d1 is used to represent both su\u00fa as in su\u00fad\u00e1li, meaning \"six\" (\u13d1\u13d3\u13b5), and s\u00fah as in s\u00fahdi, meaning \"fishhook\" (\u13d1\u13d7).\nThere is no regular rule for representing consonant clusters. When consonants other than s, h, or glottal stop arise in clusters with other consonants, a vowel must be inserted, chosen either arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel, see vowel deletion for instance). For example, \u13e7\u13be\u13cd\u13d7 (tsu-na-s-di) represents the word juunsdi\u030b, meaning \"small (pl.), babies\". The consonant cluster ns is broken down by insertion of the vowel a, and is spelled as \u13be\u13cd /nas/. The vowel is etymological as juunsdi\u030b is composed of the morphemes di-uunii-asdii\u030b\u0294i, where a is part of the root. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced.\nTones are not marked in the script.\nAs with some other writing systems, proficient speakers can distinguish words by context.\nIf a labial plosive appears in a borrowed word or name, it is written using the qu row. This /kw/ ~ /p/ correspondence is a known linguistic phenomenon that exists elsewhere (cf. P-Celtic, Osco-Umbrian). The l and tl rows are similarly used for borrowings containing r or tr/dr, respectively, and s (including within ts) can represent /s/, /\u0283/, /z/, or /\u0292/, as indicated in the above word juunsdi\u030b.\n\nTransliteration issues\nSome Cherokee words pose a problem for transliteration software because they contain adjacent pairs of single letter symbols that (without special provisions) would be combined when doing the back-conversion from Latin script to Cherokee. Here are a few examples:\n\nFor these examples, the back conversion is likely to join s-a as sa or s-i as si, as the consonant s can be written either with its own isolated glyph, or combined with a following vowel -- but the vowel itself doesn't require being attached to a consonant. One solution is to use a middle dot to separate the two, While some use an apostrophe instead, apostrophes are also used to represent a glottal stop in Cherokee.\nOther Cherokee words contain character pairs that entail overlapping transliteration sequences. For example:\n\n\u13c0\u13be transliterates as nahna, yet so does \u13be\u13bf. The former is nah-na, the latter is na-hna.\n\u13a4\u13e1\u13c0\u13a0 transliterates as utlunaha, yet so does \u13a4\u13e1\u13be\u13ad. The former is u-tlu-nah-a, the latter is u-tlu-na-ha.\nIf the Latin script is parsed from left to right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back conversion would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving these character combinations: nahe nahi naho nahu nahv.\nA further problem encountered in transliterating Cherokee is that there are some pairs of different Cherokee words that transliterate to the same word in the Latin script. For example:\n\n\u13a0\u13cd\u13a1\u13c3 and \u13a0\u13ce\u13c3 both transliterate to aseno\n\u13a8\u13cd\u13a5\u13a2 and \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2 both transliterate to gesvi\nWithout special provision, a round trip conversion may change \u13a0\u13cd\u13a1\u13c3 to \u13a0\u13ce\u13c3 and change \u13a8\u13cd\u13a5\u13a2 to \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2.\n\nCharacter orders\nThere are two main character orders for the Cherokee script. The usual order for Cherokee runs across the rows of the syllabary chart from left to right, top to bottom\u2014this is the one used in the Unicode block. It has also been alphabetized based on the six columns of the syllabary chart from top to bottom, left to right.\n\nNumerals\nModern Cherokee generally uses Arabic numerals. In the late 1820s, several years after the introduction and adoption of his syllabary, Sequoyah proposed a set of number signs for Cherokee; however, these were never adopted and never typeset. In 2012, the Cherokee Language Consortium agreed to begin using Sequoyah's numerals in some instances.\nSequoyah developed unique characters for 1 through 19, and then characters for the \"tens\" of 20 through 100. Additional symbols were used to note thousands and millions, and Sequoyah also used a final symbol to mark the end of a number. The glyphs for 1 through 20 can be grouped into groups of five that have a visual similarity to each other (1\u20135, 6\u201310, 11\u201315, and 16\u201320). The Cherokee Language Consortium has created an additional symbol for zero along with symbols for billions and trillions. As of Unicode 13.0, Cherokee numerals are not encoded within Unicode.\nSequoyah's proposed numeral system has been described as having a \"ciphered-additive structure,\" using combinations of the characters for 1 through 9 with the characters for 20 through 100 to create larger numbers. For example, instead of writing 64, the Cherokee numerals for 60 and 4 () would be written together. To write 10 through 19, unique characters for each number are employed. For numbers larger than 100, the system takes on features of a multiplicative-additive system, with the digits for 1 through being placed before the hundred, thousand, or million sign to indicate large numbers; for example, for 504, the Cherokee numerals for 5, 100, and 4 () would be written together.\n\nClasses\nCherokee language classes typically begin with a transliteration of Cherokee into Roman letters, only later incorporating the syllabary. The Cherokee language classes offered through Haskell Indian Nations University, Northeastern State University, the University of Oklahoma, the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Western Carolina University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the immersion elementary schools offered by the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, such as New Kituwah Academy, all teach the syllabary. The fine arts degree program at Southwestern Community College incorporates the syllabary in its printmaking classes.\n\nUnicode\nCherokee was added to the Unicode standard in September 1999, with the release of version 3.0. The character repertoire was extended to include a complete set of lowercase Cherokee letters as well as the archaic character (\u13f5).\nOn June 17, 2015, with the release of version 8.0, the Unicode Consortium encoded a lowercase version of the script and redefined Cherokee as a bicameral script. Typists would often set Cherokee with two different point sizes so as to mark beginnings of sentences and given names (as in the Latin alphabet). Handwritten Cherokee also shows a difference in lower- and uppercase letters, such as descenders and ascenders. Lowercase Cherokee has already been encoded in the font Everson Mono.\n\nBlocks\nThe first Unicode block for Cherokee is U+13A0\u2013U+13FF. It contains all 86 uppercase letters, together with six lowercase letters:\n\nThe Cherokee Supplement block is U+AB70\u2013U+ABBF. It contains the remaining 80 lowercase letters.\n\nFonts\nA single Cherokee Unicode font, Plantagenet Cherokee, is supplied with macOS, version 10.3 (Panther) and later. Windows Vista also includes a Cherokee font.  Windows 10 replaced Plantagenet Cherokee with Gadugi after the Cherokee language term for \"working together\".\nSeveral free Cherokee fonts are available including Digohweli, Donisiladv, and Noto Sans Cherokee. Some pan-Unicode fonts, such as Code2000, Everson Mono, and GNU FreeFont, include Cherokee characters. A commercial font, Phoreus Cherokee, published by TypeCulture, includes multiple weights and styles.\n\nSee also\nCanadian Aboriginal syllabics\nCree syllabics\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nBender, Margaret. 2002.

It is the first (native) language of a large majority of Ukrainians.\nWritten Ukrainian uses the Ukrainian alphabet, a variant of the Cyrillic script. The standard language is studied by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and Potebnia Institute of Linguistics. Comparisons are often made between Ukrainian and Russian, another East Slavic language, yet there is more mutual intelligibility with Belarusian, and a closer lexical distance to West Slavic Polish and South Slavic Bulgarian.\nUkrainian is a descendant of Old East Slavic, a language spoken in the medieval state of Kievan Rus'. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the language developed into Ruthenian, where it became an official language, before a process of Polonization began in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. By the 18th century, Ruthenian diverged into regional variants, and the modern Ukrainian language developed in the territory of present-day Ukraine. Russification saw the Ukrainian language banned as a subject from schools and as a language of instruction in the Russian Empire, and continued in various ways in the Soviet Union. Even so, the language continued to see use throughout the country, and remained particularly strong in Western Ukraine.\n\nLinguistic development\nTheories\nSpecific developments that led to a gradual change of the Old East Slavic vowel system into the system found in modern Ukrainian began approximately in the 12th/13th century (that is, still at the time of the Kievan Rus') with a lengthening and raising of the Old East Slavic mid vowels e and o when followed by a consonant and a weak yer vowel that would eventually disappear completely, for example Old East Slavic \u043a\u043e\u0442\u044a /k\u0254t\u0259/ > Ukrainian \u043a\u0456\u0442 /kit/ 'cat' (via transitional stages such as /ko\u02d1t\u0259\u0306/, /ku\u02d1t(\u0259\u0306)/, /ky\u02d1t/ or similar) or Old East Slavic \u043f\u0435\u0447\u044c /p\u02b2\u025bt\u0283\u02b2\u0259/ > Ukrainian \u043f\u0456\u0447 /pit\u0283/ 'oven' (via transitional stages such as /p\u02b2e\u02d1t\u0283\u02b2\u0259\u0306/, /p\u02b2i\u02d1t\u0283\u02b2/ or similar). This raising and other phonological developments of the time, such as the merger of the Old East Slavic vowel phonemes \u0438 /i/ and \u044b /\u0268/ into the specifically Ukrainian phoneme /\u026a ~ e/, spelled with \u0438 (in the 13th/14th centuries), and the fricativisation of the Old East Slavic consonant \u0433 /g/, probably first to /\u0263/ (in the 13th century), with /\u0266/ as a reflex in Modern Ukrainian, did not happen in Russian. Only the fricativisation of Old East Slavic \u0433 /g/ occurred in Belarusian, where the present-day reflex is /\u0263/.\nAhatanhel Krymsky and Aleksey Shakhmatov assumed the existence of the common spoken language of Eastern Slavs only in prehistoric times. According to their point of view, the diversification of the Old East Slavic language took place in the 8th or early 9th century.\nRussian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak stated that the Old Novgorod dialect differed significantly from that of other dialects of Kievan Rus' during the 11th\u201312th century, but started becoming more similar to them around the 13th\u201315th centuries. The modern Russian language hence developed from the fusion of this Novgorod dialect and the common dialect spoken by the other Kievan Rus', whereas the modern Ukrainian and Belarusian languages developed from dialects which did not differ from each other in a significant way.\nUkrainian linguist Stepan Smal-Stotsky denies the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past. Similar points of view were shared by Yevhen Tymchenko, Vsevolod Hantsov, Olena Kurylo, Ivan Ohienko and others. According to this theory, the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto-Slavic language without any intermediate stages during the 6th through 9th centuries. The Ukrainian language was formed by convergence of tribal dialects, mostly due to an intensive migration of the population within the territory of today's Ukraine in later historical periods. This point of view was also supported by George Shevelov's phonological studies, which argue that specific features were already recognizable in the southern dialects of Old East Slavic (seen as ancestors to Ukrainian) as far back as these varieties can be documented.\n\nOrigins and developments during medieval times\nAs a result of close Slavic contacts with the remnants of the Scythian and Sarmatian population north of the Black Sea, lasting into the early Middle Ages, the appearance of the voiced fricative \u03b3/\u0433 (romanized \"h\"), in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained by the assumption that it initially emerged in Scythian and related eastern Iranian dialects, from earlier common Proto-Indo-European *g and *g\u02b0.\nDuring the 13th century, when German settlers were invited to Ukraine by the princes of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, German words began to appear in the language spoken in Ukraine. Their influence would continue under Poland not only through German colonists but also through the Yiddish-speaking Jews. Often such words involve trade or handicrafts. Examples of words of German or Yiddish origin spoken in Ukraine include dakh (\"roof\"), rura (\"pipe\"), rynok (\"market\"), kushnir (\"furrier\"), and majster (\"master\" or \"craftsman\").\n\nDevelopments under Poland and Lithuania\nIn the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus (including Moscow) came under Tatar rule until their unification under the Tsardom of Muscovy, whereas the south-western areas (including Kyiv) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For the following four centuries, the languages of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other. Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century. By the 16th century, a peculiar official language formed: a mixture of  the liturgical standardised language of Old Church Slavonic, Ruthenian and Polish. The influence of the latter gradually increased relative to the former two, as the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the szlachta, was largely Polish-speaking. Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics.\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian rule and education also involved significant exposure to the Latin language. Much of the influence of Poland on the development of the Ukrainian language has been attributed to this period and is reflected in multiple words and constructions used in everyday Ukrainian speech that were taken from Polish or Latin. Examples of Polish words adopted from this period include zavzhdy (always; taken from old Polish word zaw\u017cdy) and obitsiaty (to promise; taken from Polish obieca\u0107) and from Latin (via Polish) raptom (suddenly) and meta (aim or goal).\nSignificant contact with Tatars and Turks resulted in many Turkic words, particularly those involving military matters and steppe industry, being adopted into the Ukrainian language.  Examples include torba (bag) and tyutyun (tobacco).\nBecause of the substantial number of loanwords from Polish, German, Czech and Latin, early modern vernacular Ukrainian (prosta mova, \"simple speech\") had more lexical similarity with West Slavic languages than with Russian or Church Slavonic. By the mid-17th century, the linguistic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages had become so significant that there was a need for translators during negotiations for the Treaty of Pereyaslav, between Bohdan Khmelnytsky, head of the Zaporozhian Host, and the Russian state.\nBy the 18th century, Ruthenian had diverged into regional variants, developing into the modern Belarusian, Rusyn, and Ukrainian languages.\n\nChronology\nThe accepted chronology of Ukrainian divides the language into Old Ukrainian, Middle Ukrainian, and Modern Ukrainian. Shevelov explains that much of this is based on the character of contemporary written sources, ultimately reflecting socio-historical developments, and he further subdivides the Middle period into three phases:\n\nProto-Ukrainian (abbreviated PU, Ukrainian: protoukrajins\u02bckyj period, until the mid-11th century), with no extant written sources by speakers in Ukraine. Corresponding to aspects of Old East Slavic.\nOld Ukrainian (OU, davn\u02bcoukrajins\u02bckyj period or davn\u02bcoukrajins\u02bcka mova, mid-11th to 14th c., conventional end date 1387), elements of phonology are deduced from written texts mainly in Church Slavic. Part of broader Old East Slavic.\nMiddle Ukrainian (seredn\u02bcoukrajins\u02bckyj period or staroukrajins\u02bcka mova, 15th to 18th c.), historically called Ruthenian.\nEarly Middle Ukrainian (EMU, rann\u02bcoseredn\u02bcoukrajins\u02bckyj period, 15th to mid-16th c., 1387\u20131575), analysis focuses on distinguishing Ukrainian and Belarusian texts.\nMiddle Ukrainian (MU, seredn\u02bcoukrajins\u02bckyj period, mid-16th to early 18th c., 1575\u20131720), represented by several vernacular language varieties as well as a version of Church Slavonic.\nLate Middle Ukrainian (LMU, piznoseredn\u02bcoukrajins\u02bckyj period, rest of the 18th c., 1720\u20131818), found in many mixed Ukrainian\u2013Russian and Russian\u2013Ukrainian texts.\nModern Ukrainian (MoU, from the very end of the 18th c., su\u010dasnyj period or su\u010dasna ukrajins\u02bcka mova, from 1818), the vernacular recognized first in literature, and subsequently all other written genres.\nUkraine annually marks the Day of Ukrainian Writing and Language on 9 November, the Eastern Orthodox feast day of Nestor the Chronicler.\n\nHistory of the spoken language\nRus' and Kingdom of Ruthenia\nThe era of Kievan Rus' (c. 880\u20131240) is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily Old Church Slavonic. Some theorists see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old Ruthenian; others term this era Old East Slavic. Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus' to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era Old Russian. However, according to Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak (2012), people from the Novgorod Republic did not call themselves Rus' until the 14th century; earlier Novgorodians reserved the term Rus' for the Kiev, Pereyaslavl and Chernigov principalities. At the same time as evidenced by contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes and kings of Galicia\u2013Volhynia and Kiev called themselves \"people of Rus'\" (in foreign sources called \"Ruthenians\"), and Galicia\u2013Volhynia has alternately been called the Principality or Kingdom of Ruthenia.\nAlso according to Andrey Zaliznyak, the Novgorodian dialect differed significantly from that of other dialects of Kievan Rus during the 11th\u201312th century, but  \nstarted becoming more similar to them around 13th\u201315th centuries. The modern Russian language hence developed from the fusion of this Novgorodian dialect and the common dialect spoken by the other Kievan Rus, whereas the modern Ukrainian and Belarusian languages developed from the dialects which did not differ from each other in a significant way.\n\nUnder Lithuania/Poland and Muscovy/Russia\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, Ukrainians mainly fell under the rule of Lithuania and then Poland. Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old East Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language. Polish rule, which came later, was accompanied by a more assimilationist policy. By the 1569 Union of Lublin that formed the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to Polish administration, resulting in cultural Polonization and visible attempts to colonize Ukraine by the Polish nobility.\nMany Ukrainian nobles learned the Polish language and converted to Catholicism during that period in order to maintain their lofty aristocratic position. Lower classes were less affected because literacy was common only in the upper class and clergy. The latter were also under significant Polish pressure after the Union with the Catholic Church. Most of the educational system was gradually Polonized. In Ruthenia, the language of administrative documents gradually shifted towards Polish.\nPolish has had heavy influences on Ukrainian (particularly in Western Ukraine). The southwestern Ukrainian dialects are transitional to Polish. As the Ukrainian language developed further, some borrowings from Tatar and Turkish occurred. Ukrainian culture and language flourished in the sixteenth and first half of the 17th century, when Ukraine was part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, albeit in spite of being part of the PLC, not as a result. Among many schools established in that time, the Kyiv-Mohyla Collegium (the predecessor of the modern Kyiv-Mohyla Academy), founded by the Orthodox Metropolitan Peter Mogila, was the most important. At that time languages were associated more with religions: Catholics spoke Polish, and members of the Orthodox church spoke Ruthenian.\nThe 1654 Pereiaslav Agreement between Cossack Hetmanate and Alexis of Russia divided Ukraine between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia. During the following century, both monarchies became increasingly intolerant of Ukrainian own cultural and political aspirations. Ukrainians found themselves in a colonial situation. The Russian centre adopted the name Little Russia for Ukraine and Little Russian for the language, an expression that originated in Byzantine Greek and may originally have meant \"old, original, fundamental Russia\", and had been in use since the 14th century. Ukrainian high culture went into a long period of steady decline. The Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was taken over by the Russian Empire. Most of the remaining Ukrainian schools also switched to Polish or Russian in the territories controlled by these respective countries, which was followed by a new wave of Polonization and Russification of the native nobility. Gradually the official language of Ukrainian provinces under Poland was changed to Polish, while the upper classes in the Russian part of Ukraine used Russian.\n\nIn Austrian Galicia and Lodomeria (1772\u20131918)\nAfter the 1772 First Partition of Poland, when the lands annexed by the Austrian Habsburg monarchy were reorganised as the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, the Habsburg administration was initially surprised to find out that, apart from Poles, there were a lot of other people living in it whom they began calling Ruthenen (\"Ruthenians\" or \"Rusyny\"). They differed from the Poles in that the vast majority of them adhered to the Greek Catholic faith (organised as the Ruthenian Uniate Church) rather than Roman Catholic, and that their liturgical language was Church Slavonic rather than Latin. Most of them had not received much education; they used Ruthenian only as a spoken language, few could read or write, and those who did more often used Polish or (increasingly) German instead. As Empress Maria Theresa had introduced a general compulsory education (Allgemeiner Schulzwang) in 1774, and enacted it in newly-acquired Galicia and Lodomeria in 1777, the decision was made to produce Polish and Ruthenian textbooks that were used in elementary schools for those language communities. \n\n{{}}\nAlthough some Ruthenian parish schools were established in some villages, and some printed primers and catechisms in Ruthenian were distributed there, the effects of Ruthenian-language education achieved very little until 1815. That year, Ivan Mohylnytsky, a Przemy\u015bl eparchy canon who contributed to the establishment of a strong network of Ruthenian parish schools and a teacher training school, published a catechism at the Royal University of Buda entitled Christian Learning in the Case of the Common Catechism for Parish Children. He followed this up in 1823 by a Grammar of the Slovene\u2013Ruthenian language (never published), and in 1829 by his treatise Information on the Ruthenian Language (published both in Polish as Rozprawa o i\u0119zyku ruskim and in Russian as \"\u0412\u0456\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u0446\u0456\"), which represents the first scholarly study arguing that Ruthenian was a language in its own right, separate from Polish, Russian, and Church Slavonic. On the other hand, new educational regulations in 1818 determined that schools that were exclusively attended by children of Greek Catholic parents were to receive instruction in Ruthenian, whereas schools attended by children of both Roman Catholic and Greek Catholic parents had Polish as the medium of instruction. Nevertheless, pupils at Ruthenian-instruction schools had to learn Polish as a second language as well. In higher education, Ruthenian was not valued as an equal language, and students were expected to learn and use Latin and Polish instead. Students training to become Greek Catholic priests at the University of Lviv did receive instruction in Ruthenian in the so-called \"Studium ruthenum\" according to Austrian regulations between 1787 and 1809, but it was not a fully-fledged course; instead, it was regarded as a temporary measure for students who did not yet know Latin. Both its professors and alumni received only half the salary of their counterparts from the \"Studium latinum\", the number of students steadily decreased over the decades, and in 1809 the Ruthenians themselves requested the \"Studium ruthenum\" to be abandoned.\nIn the first few decades of the Austrian period in Galicia, there was also confusion amongst both the Habsburg administration and educated Ruthenians about which variety of written Ruthenian to use: late Church Slavonic, literary Russian, traditional written Ruthenian, or something close to how Ruthenian was actually spoken in Galicia at that time. The Habsburg Imperial censor for Slavic publications, Jernej Kopitar (himself from Slovenia), encouraged Ruthenian authors to base their written language on the Ruthenian vernacular, and from December 1833 onwards, to write Ruthenian in a Latin alphabet rather than Cyrillic. This initiated a discussion on Ruthenian identity, later called the \"First Alphabet War\" or \"Blizzard\". Although most Ruthenian intellectuals did respond by increasingly basing their writings on spoken Ruthenian, the majority of them defended the use Cyrillic over concerns of Polonisation. Nevertheless, they could not agree on various standardisation issues; three different Ruthenian grammars were published between 1834 and 1848, and none of them was widely adopted. Before 1848, no Ruthenian dictionaries were produced, no Ruthenian-language periodical press existed within Habsburg Galicia, and Ruthenian played no role as language of administration.\n\nThe Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire changed everything: the native languages of most populations in the Empire, including Ruthenian, were accorded official status, and all laws in the Danubian monarchy would be published in these languages from 1 October 1849 onwards. Ruthenian would henceforth to be used in local administration in the Landesgesetzbl\u00e4tter. From 1849 onwards, various official periodicals were established in Ruthenian, and the Interior Ministry stipulated in July 1849 that street signs in Lviv had to include Ruthenian versions. In October 1852, the Ministry of Justice also decreed that Ruthenian could be used by parties involved in legal issues in their communication with the courts of law, although it would take until 1861 to allow these letters to employ skoropys Cyrillic rather than Latin script (or the Muscovite gra\u017edanka variety of Cyrillic). In the post-1848, there were some contradictory developments, some of which countered Polonisation in the sphere of education, while others stimulated further Polonisation in the sphere of administration. Similarly, Galician Russophilia or Moscophilia strived towards ever greater assimilation of Ruthenian towards the so-called \"Great Russian\" language as used in Moscow that still heavily leaned on Church Slavonic, while both the Habsburg administration and Greek Catholic Church raised concerns that these were \"barely comprehensible\" to the common people of Galicia and hampered the \"development of the Ruthenian language\", adding that Orthodox Imperial Russia was a threat to the overwhelmingly Catholic Habsburg realm. \nMatters once again came to a head in May 1859, when the Polish governor of Galicia Go\u0142uchowski recommended Czech linguist Josef Jire\u010dek's proposal for a Ruthenian Latin alphabet, leading to the \"Second Alphabet War\" or \"Blizzard\". Ruthenian intellectuals almost unanimously rejected the proposal for fear of Polonisation, leading the government to overreact by banning the \"Russian script\" (meaning the Muscovite gra\u017edanka) in July 1859, which Ruthenian writers generally ignored. By March 1861, the Habsburg State Ministry essentially conceded defeat by stating that the Ruthenians themselves were responsible for developing their own language, and that it was not up to the government. Around the same time, however, Ruthenian intellectuals became acquainted with the writings of Ukrainian intellectuals from \"Little Russia\" in the Russian Empire, such as poet Taras Shevchenko (died 1861), who was fiercely anti-Russian and Ukrainophile, leading many earlier Galician Ruthenians to abandon their Russophilia. In between the pro-Polish and pro-Russian tendencies, the Ruthenian language in Galicia would gradually develop into an independent literary and intellectual written language in the second half of the 19th century, when it was increasingly called \"Ukrainian\".\n\nIn the Russian Empire\nDuring the 19th century, a revival of Ukrainian self-identification manifested in the literary classes of both Russian-Empire Dnieper Ukraine and Austrian Galicia. The Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius in Kyiv applied an old word for the Cossack motherland, Ukrajina, as a self-appellation for the nation of Ukrainians, and Ukrajins'ka mova for the language. Many writers published works in the Romantic tradition of Europe demonstrating that Ukrainian was not merely a language of the village but suitable for literary pursuits.\nHowever, in the Russian Empire expressions of Ukrainian culture and especially language were repeatedly persecuted for fear that a self-aware Ukrainian nation would threaten the unity of the empire. In 1804 Ukrainian as a subject and language of instruction was banned from schools. In 1811, by order of the Russian government, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was closed.\nIn 1847 the Brotherhood of St Cyril and Methodius was terminated. The same year Taras Shevchenko was arrested, exiled for ten years, and banned for political reasons from writing and painting. In 1862 Pavlo Chubynsky was exiled for seven years to Arkhangelsk. The Ukrainian magazine Osnova was discontinued. In 1863, the tsarist interior minister Pyotr Valuyev proclaimed in his decree that \"there never has been, is not, and never can be a separate Little Russian language\".\nAlthough the name of Ukraine is known since 1187, it was not applied to the language until the mid-19th century. The linguonym Ukrainian language appears in Yakub Holovatsky's book from 1849, listed there as a variant name of the Little Russian language. In a private letter from 1854, Taras Shevchenko lauds \"our splendid Ukrainian language\". Valuyev's decree from 1863 derides the \"Little Russian\" language throughout, but also mentions \"the so-called Ukrainian language\" once. In Galicia, the earliest applications of the term Ukrainian to the language were in the hyphenated names Ukrainian-Ruthenian (1866, by Paulin \u015awi\u0119cicki) or Ruthenian-Ukrainian (1871, by Panteleimon Kulish and Ivan Puluj), with non-hyphenated Ukrainian language appearing shortly thereafter (in 1878, by Mykhailo Drahomanov).\nA following ban on Ukrainian books led to Alexander II's secret Ems Ukaz, which prohibited publication and importation of most Ukrainian-language books, public performances and lectures, and even banned the printing of Ukrainian texts accompanying musical scores. A period of leniency after 1905 was followed by another strict ban in 1914, which also affected Russian-occupied Galicia.\nFor much of the 19th century the Austrian authorities demonstrated some preference for Polish culture, but the Ukrainians were relatively free to partake in their own cultural pursuits in Halychyna and Bukovina, where Ukrainian was widely used in education and official documents. The suppression by Russia hampered the literary development of the Ukrainian language in Dnipro Ukraine, but there was a constant exchange with Halychyna, and many works were published under Austria and smuggled to the east.\nBy the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the collapse of Austro-Hungary in 1918, Ukrainians were ready to openly develop a body of national literature, institute a Ukrainian-language educational system, and form an independent state (the Ukrainian People's Republic, shortly joined by the West Ukrainian People's Republic). During this brief independent statehood the stature and use of Ukrainian greatly improved.\n\nSpeakers in the Russian Empire\nIn the Russian Empire Census of 1897 the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire. According to the Imperial census's terminology, the Russian language (\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0456\u0439) was subdivided into Ukrainian (\u041c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0456\u0439, 'Little Russian'), what is known as Russian today (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0456\u0439, 'Great Russian'), and Belarusian (\u0411\u0463\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0456\u0439, 'White Russian').\nThe following table shows the distribution of settlement by native language (\"\u043f\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443\") in 1897 in Russian Empire governorates (guberniyas) that had more than 100,000 Ukrainian speakers.\n\nAlthough in the rural regions of the Ukrainian provinces, 80% of the inhabitants said that Ukrainian was their native language in the Census of 1897 (for which the results are given above), in the urban regions only 32.5% of the population claimed Ukrainian as their native language. For example, in Odesa (then part of the Russian Empire), at the time the largest city in the territory of current Ukraine, only 5.6% of the population said Ukrainian was their native language.\nUntil the 1920s the urban population in Ukraine grew faster than the number of Ukrainian speakers. This implies that there was a (relative) decline in the use of Ukrainian language. For example, in Kyiv, the number of people stating that Ukrainian was their native language declined from 30.3% in 1874 to 16.6% in 1917.\n\nSoviet era\nDuring the seven-decade-long Soviet era, the Ukrainian language held the formal position of the principal local language in the Ukrainian SSR. However, practice was often a different story: Ukrainian always had to compete with Russian, and the attitudes of the Soviet leadership towards Ukrainian varied from encouragement and tolerance to de facto banishment.\nOfficially, there was no state language in the Soviet Union until the very end when it was proclaimed in 1990 that Russian language was the all-Union state language and that the constituent republics had rights to declare additional state languages within their jurisdictions. Still it was implicitly understood in the hopes of minority nations that Ukrainian would be used in the Ukrainian SSR, Uzbek would be used in the Uzbek SSR, and so on. However, Russian was used as the lingua franca in all parts of the Soviet Union and a special term, \"a language of inter-ethnic communication\", was coined to denote its status.\n\nStalin\nKhrushchev thaw\nAfter the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963). The Khrushchev era which followed saw a policy of relatively lenient concessions to development of the languages at the local and republic level, though its results in Ukraine did not go nearly as far as those of the Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s. Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as transfer of Crimea under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction.\nYet, the 1958 school reform that allowed parents to choose the language of primary instruction for their children, unpopular among the circles of the national intelligentsia in parts of the USSR, meant that non-Russian languages would slowly give way to Russian in light of the pressures of survival and advancement. The gains of the past, already largely reversed by the Stalin era, were offset by the liberal attitude towards the requirement to study the local languages (the requirement to study Russian remained).\nParents were usually free to choose the language of study of their children (except in few areas where attending the Ukrainian school might have required a long daily commute) and they often chose Russian, which reinforced the resulting Russification. In this sense, some analysts argue that it was not the \"oppression\" or \"persecution\", but rather the lack of protection against the expansion of Russian language that contributed to the relative decline of Ukrainian in the 1970s and 1980s. According to this view, it was inevitable that successful careers required a good command of Russian, while knowledge of Ukrainian was not vital, so it was common for Ukrainian parents to send their children to Russian-language schools, even though Ukrainian-language schools were usually available.\nThe number of students in Russian-language in Ukraine schools was constantly increasing, from 14 percent in 1939 to more than 30 percent in 1962.\n\nShelest period\nThe Communist Party leader from 1963 to 1972, Petro Shelest, pursued a policy of defending Ukraine's interests within the Soviet Union. He proudly promoted the beauty of the Ukrainian language and developed plans to expand the role of Ukrainian in higher education. He was removed, however, after only a brief tenure, for being too lenient on Ukrainian nationalism.\n\nShcherbytsky period\nThe new party boss from 1972 to 1989, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, purged the local party, was fierce in suppressing dissent, and insisted Russian be spoken at all official functions, even at local levels. His policy of Russification was lessened only slightly after 1985.\n\nGorbachev and perebudova\nThe management of dissent by the local Ukrainian Communist Party was more fierce and thorough than in other parts of the Soviet Union. As a result, at the start of the Mikhail Gorbachev reforms perebudova and hlasnist\u2019 (Ukrainian for perestroika and glasnost), Ukraine under Shcherbytsky was slower to liberalize than Russia itself.\nAlthough Ukrainian still remained the native language for the majority in the nation on the eve of Ukrainian independence, a significant share of ethnic Ukrainians were russified. In Donetsk there were no Ukrainian language schools and in Kyiv only a quarter of children went to Ukrainian language schools.\nThe Russian language was the dominant vehicle, not just of government function, but of the media, commerce, and modernity itself. This was substantially less the case for western Ukraine, which escaped the artificial famine, Great Purge, and most of Stalinism. And this region became the center of a hearty, if only partial, renaissance of the Ukrainian language during independence.\n\nIndependence in the modern era\nSince 1991, Ukrainian has been the official state language in Ukraine, and the state administration implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian. The educational system in Ukraine has been transformed over the first decade of independence from a system that is partly Ukrainian to one that is overwhelmingly so. The government has also mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce.\nIn the 2001 census, 67.5% of the country's population named Ukrainian as their native language (a 2.8% increase from 1989), while 29.6% named Russian (a 3.2% decrease). For many Ukrainians (of various ethnic origins), the term native language may not necessarily associate with the language they use more frequently. The overwhelming majority of ethnic Ukrainians consider the Ukrainian language native, including those who often speak Russian.\nAccording to the official 2001 census data, 92.3% of Kyiv region population responded \"Ukrainian\" to the native language (ridna mova) census question, compared with 88.4% in 1989, and 7.2% responded \"Russian\". \nIn 2019, the law of Ukraine \"On protecting the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language\" was approved by the parliament, formalizing rules governing the usage of the language and introducing penalties for violations.\n\nLiterature and literary language\nThe literary Ukrainian language, which was preceded by Old East Slavic literature, may be subdivided into two stages: during the 12th to 18th centuries what in Ukraine is referred to as \"Old Ukrainian\", but elsewhere, and in contemporary sources, is known as the Ruthenian language, and from the end of the 18th century to the present what in Ukraine is known as \"Modern Ukrainian\", but elsewhere is known as just Ukrainian.\nInfluential literary figures in the development of modern Ukrainian literature include the philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda, Ivan Kotlyarevsky, Mykola Kostomarov, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Shevchenko, Ivan Franko, and Lesia Ukrainka. The earliest literary work in the Ukrainian language was recorded in 1798 when Kotlyarevsky, a playwright from Poltava in southeastern Ukraine, published his epic poem, Eneyida, a burlesque in Ukrainian, based on Virgil's Aeneid. His book was published in vernacular Ukrainian in a satirical way to avoid being censored, and is the earliest known Ukrainian published book to survive through Imperial and, later, Soviet policies on the Ukrainian language.\nKotlyarevsky's work and that of another early writer using the Ukrainian vernacular language, Petro Artemovsky, used the southeastern dialect spoken in the Poltava, Kharkiv and southern Kyiven regions of the Russian Empire. This dialect would serve as the basis of the Ukrainian literary language when it was developed by Shevchenko and Kulish in the mid 19th century. In order to raise its status from that of a dialect to that of a language, various elements from folklore and traditional styles were added to it.\nThe Ukrainian literary language developed further when the Russian state banned the use of the Ukrainian language, prompting many of its writers to move to the western Ukrainian region of Galicia which was under more liberal Austrian rule; after the 1860s the majority of Ukrainian literary works were published in Austrian Galicia.  During this period Galician influences were adopted in the Ukrainian literary language, particularly with respect to vocabulary involving law, government, technology, science, and administration.\n\nCurrent usage\nThe use of the Ukrainian language is increasing after a long period of decline. Although there are almost fifty million ethnic Ukrainians worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine in 2001 (77.8% of the total population at the time), the Ukrainian language is prevalent mainly in western and central Ukraine. In Kyiv, both Ukrainian and Russian are spoken, a notable shift from the recent past when the city was primarily Russian-speaking.\nThe shift is believed to be caused mainly by an influx of migrants from western regions of Ukraine but also by some Kyivans opting to use the language they speak at home more widely in public settings. Public signs and announcements in Kyiv are displayed in Ukrainian. In southern and eastern Ukraine, Russian is the prevalent language in most large and some small cities. According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, 87.8% of people living in Ukraine were fluent in Ukrainian.\nIn August 2022, a survey in Ukraine by Rating Group found that 85% said they speak Ukrainian or Ukrainian and Russian at home, 51% only Ukrainian, an increase from 61% and 44% in February 2014. In the same survey, 76% considered Ukrainian their native language (ridna mova), up from 57% in July 2012, including 30% of Russian speakers.\n\nPopular culture\nMusic\nUkrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Ukrainian language. The most popular Ukrainian rock bands, such as Okean Elzy, Vopli Vidopliassova, and BoomBox perform regularly in tours across Europe, Israel, North America and especially Russia. In countries with significant Ukrainian populations, bands singing in the Ukrainian language sometimes reach top places on the charts, such as Enej (a band from Poland). Other notable Ukrainian-language bands are The Ukrainians from the United Kingdom, Klooch from Canada, Ukrainian Village Band from the United States, and the Kuban Cossack Choir from the Kuban region in Russia.\n\nCinema\nThe 2010s saw a revival of Ukrainian cinema. The top Ukrainian-language films (by IMDb rating) are:\n\nArgots\nOleksa Horbach's 1951 study of argots analyzed historical primary sources (argots of professionals, thugs, prisoners, homeless, school children, etc.) paying special attention to etymological features of argots, word formation and borrowing patterns depending on the source-language (Church Slavonic, Russian, Czech, Polish, Romani, Greek, Romanian, Hungarian, German).\n\nDialects\nSeveral modern dialects of Ukrainian exist.\n\nNorthern (Polissian) dialects:\n(3) Eastern Polissian is spoken in Chernihiv (excluding the southeastern districts), in the northern part of Sumy, and in the southeastern portion of the Kyiv Oblast as well as in the adjacent areas of Russia, which include the southwestern part of the Bryansk Oblast (the area around Starodub), as well as in some places in the Kursk, Voronezh and Belgorod Oblasts. No linguistic border can be defined. The vocabulary approaches Russian as the language approaches the Russian Federation. Both Ukrainian and Russian grammar sets can be applied to this dialect.\n(2) Central Polissian is spoken in the northwestern part of the Kyiv Oblast, in the northern part of Zhytomyr and the northeastern part of the Rivne Oblast.\n(1) West Polissian is spoken in the northern part of the Volyn Oblast, the northwestern part of the Rivne Oblast, and in the adjacent districts of the Brest Region in Belarus. The dialect spoken in Belarus uses Belarusian grammar and thus is considered by some to be a dialect of Belarusian.\nSoutheastern dialects:\n(4) Middle Dnieprian is the basis of the Standard Literary Ukrainian. It is spoken in the central part of Ukraine, primarily in the southern and eastern part of the Kyiv Oblast. In addition, the dialects spoken in Cherkasy, Poltava, and Kyiv regions are considered to be close to \"standard\" Ukrainian.\n(5) Slobodan is spoken in Kharkiv, Sumy, Luhansk, and the northern part of Donetsk, as well as in the Voronezh and Belgorod regions of Russia. This dialect is formed from a gradual mixture of Russian and Ukrainian, with progressively more Russian in the northern and eastern parts of the region. Thus, there is no linguistic border between Russian and Ukrainian, and, thus, both grammar sets can be applied.\nA (6) Steppe dialect is spoken in southern and southeastern Ukraine. This dialect was originally the main language of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.\nA Kuban dialect related to or based on the Steppe dialect is often referred to as Balachka and is spoken by the Kuban Cossacks in the Kuban region in Russia by the descendants of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, who settled in that area in the late 18th century. It was formed from a gradual mixture of Russian into Ukrainian. This dialect features the use of some Russian vocabulary along with some Russian grammar. There are three main variants, which have been grouped together according to location.\nSouthwestern dialects:\n(13) Boyko is spoken by the Boyko people on the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. It can also be heard across the border in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland.\n(12) Hutsul is spoken by the Hutsul people on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, in the extreme southern parts of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and in parts of the Chernivtsi and Transcarpathian Oblasts.\nLemko is spoken by the Lemko people, whose homeland rests outside the borders of Ukraine in the Pre\u0161ov Region of Slovakia along the southern side of the Carpathian Mountains, and in the southeast of modern Poland, along the northern sides of the Carpathians.\n(8) Podillian is spoken in the southern parts of the Vinnytsia and Khmelnytskyi Oblasts, in the northern part of the Odesa Oblast, and in the adjacent districts of the Cherkasy Oblast, the Kirovohrad Oblast, and the Mykolaiv Oblast.\n(7) Volynian is spoken in Rivne and Volyn, as well as in parts of Zhytomyr and Ternopil. It is also used in Che\u0142m, Poland.\n(11) Pokuttia (Bukovinian) is spoken in the Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine. This dialect has some distinct vocabulary borrowed from Romanian.\n(9) Upper Dniestrian (Kresy) is considered to be the main Galician dialect, spoken in the Lviv, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. Its distinguishing characteristics are the influence of Polish and the German vocabulary, which is reminiscent of the Austro-Hungarian rule. Some of the distinct words used in this dialect can be found here.\n(10) Upper Sannian is spoken in the border area between Ukraine and Poland in the San river valley.\nThe Rusyn language is considered by Ukrainian linguists to be a dialect of Ukrainian as well:\nDolinian Rusyn or Subcarpathian Rusyn is spoken in the Transcarpathian Oblast.\nPannonian or Ba\u010dka Rusyn is spoken in northwestern Serbia and eastern Croatia. Rusin language of the Ba\u010dka dialect is one of the official languages of the Serbian Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\nPryashiv Rusyn is the Rusyn spoken in the Pre\u0161ov (in Ukrainian: Pryashiv) region of Slovakia, as well as by some \u00e9migr\u00e9 communities, primarily in the United States of America.\n\nNeighbouring countries\nAll the countries neighbouring Ukraine (except for Hungary) historically have regions with a sizable Ukrainian population and therefore Ukrainian language speakers. Ukrainian is an official minority language in Belarus, Romania, and Moldova.\n\nUkrainian diaspora\nUkrainian is also spoken by a large \u00e9migr\u00e9e population, particularly in Canada, the United States, and several countries of South America like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The founders of this population primarily emigrated from Galicia, which used to be part of Austro-Hungary before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars. The language spoken by most of them is the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the 20th century. Compared with modern Ukrainian, the vocabulary of Ukrainians outside Ukraine reflects less influence of Russian, but often contains many loanwords from the local language.\nMost of the countries where it is spoken are ex-USSR, where many Ukrainians have migrated. Canada and the United States are also home to a large Ukrainian population. Broken up by country (to the nearest thousand):\n\nRussia 1,129,838 (according to the 2010 census);\nCanada 200,525 (67,665 spoken at home in 2001, 148,000 spoken as \"mother tongue\" in 2001)\nUkrainian is declaratively proclaimed as one of three official languages of the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria.\nUkrainian is widely spoken within the 400,000-strong (in 1994) Ukrainian community in Brazil. It is the official language in Prudent\u00f3polis alongside Portuguese.\n\nLanguage structure\nCyrillic letters in this article are romanized using scientific transliteration.\n\nGrammar\nUkrainian is a fusional, nominative\u2013accusative, satellite-framed language. It exhibits T\u2013V distinction, and is null-subject. The canonical word order of Ukrainian is SVO. Other word orders are common due to the free word order enabled by Ukrainian's inflectional system.\nNouns have one of 3 genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; nouns decline for:\n\n7 cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative;\n2 numbers: singular, plural.\nAdjectives agree with nouns in gender, case, and number.\nVerbs conjugate for:\n\n4 tenses: past, pluperfect, present, future;\n2 voices: active, mediopassive;\n3 persons: first, second, third;\n2 numbers: singular, plural.\nUkrainian verbs come in aspect pairs: perfective, and imperfective. Pairs are usually formed by a prepositional prefix and occasionally a root change. The past tense agrees with its subject in number and gender (but not person), having developed from the perfect participle.\nThe Old East Slavic and Russian o in syllables ending in a consonant, often correspond to a Ukrainian i, as in pod \u2192 pid (\u043f\u0456\u0434, 'under'). Thus, in the declension of nouns, the o can re-appear when it is no longer located in a closed syllable, such as rik (\u0440\u0456\u043a, 'year') (nom): rotsi (loc) (\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0456). Similarly, some words can have \u0456 in some cases when most of the cases have o, for example \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e (nominative singular), \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 (nominative plural) but \u0441\u043bi\u0432 (genitive plural).\nUkrainian case endings are somewhat different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian na pervom eta\u017ee 'on the first floor' is in the locative (prepositional) case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is na per\u0161omu poversi (\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0448\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0456). -omu is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in -im are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The kh of Ukrainian poverkh (\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445) has mutated into s under the influence of the soft vowel i (k is similarly mutable into c in final positions).\n\nPhonology\nThe Ukrainian language has six vowels, /i/, /u/, /\u026a/, /\u025b/, /\u0254/, /a/.\nA number of the consonants come in three forms: hard, soft (palatalized) and long, for example, /l/, /l\u02b2/, and /l\u02d0/ or /n/, /n\u02b2/, and /n\u02d0/.\nThe letter \u27e8\u0433\u27e9 represents the voiced glottal fricative /\u0266/, often transliterated as Latin h. It is the voiced equivalent of English /h/. Russian speakers from Ukraine often use the soft Ukrainian /\u0266/ in place of Russian /\u0261/, which comes from northern dialects of Old East Slavic. The Ukrainian alphabet has the additional letter \u27e8\u0491\u27e9 for /\u0261/, which appears in a few native words such as \u0491\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043b\u0438  grynd\u017eoly 'sleigh' and \u0491\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0438\u043a gudzyk 'button'. However, /\u0261/ appears almost exclusively in loan words, and is usually simply written \u27e8\u0433\u27e9. For example, loanwords from English on public signs usually use \u27e8\u0433\u27e9 for both English g and h.\nAnother phonetic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages is the pronunciation of Cyrillic \u27e8\u0432\u27e9 v/w. While in standard Russian it represents /v/, in many Ukrainian dialects it denotes /w/ (following a vowel and preceding a consonant (cluster), either within a word or at a word boundary, it denotes the allophone [u\u032f], and like the off-glide in the English words \"flow\" and \"cow\", it forms a diphthong with the preceding vowel). Native Russian speakers will pronounce the Ukrainian \u27e8\u0432\u27e9 as [v], which is one way to tell the two groups apart. As with \u27e8\u0433\u27e9 above, Ukrainians use \u27e8\u0432\u27e9 to render both English v and w; Russians occasionally use \u27e8\u0443\u27e9 for w instead.\nUnlike Russian and most other modern Slavic languages, Ukrainian does not have final devoicing.\n\nAlphabet\nUkrainian is written in a version of Cyrillic, consisting of 33 letters, representing 38 phonemes; an apostrophe is also used.  Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme, although there are a number of exceptions. The orthography also has cases where the semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied.\nThe modern Ukrainian alphabet is the result of a number of proposed alphabetic reforms from the 19th and early 20th centuries, in Ukraine under the Russian Empire, in Austrian Galicia, and later in Soviet Ukraine. A unified Ukrainian alphabet (the Skrypnykivka, after Mykola Skrypnyk) was officially established at a 1927 international Orthographic Conference in Kharkiv, during the period of Ukrainization in Soviet Ukraine.  But the policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the Soviet Ukrainian orthography diverged from that used by the diaspora. The Ukrainian letter ge \u0491 was banned in the Soviet Union from 1933 until the period of Glasnost in 1990.\nThe letter \u0449 represents two consonants [\u0283t\u0361\u0283]. The combination of [j] with some of the vowels is also represented by a single letter ([ja] = \u044f, [je] = \u0454, [ji] or [j\u0131\u033d] = \u0457, [ju] = \u044e), while [j\u0254] = \u0439\u043e and the rare regional [j\u0268] = \u0439\u0438 are written using two letters. These iotated vowel letters and a special soft sign change a preceding consonant from hard to soft. An apostrophe is used to indicate the hardness of the sound in the cases when normally the vowel would change the consonant to soft; in other words, it functions like the yer in the Russian alphabet.\nA consonant letter is doubled to indicate that the sound is doubled, or long.\nThe phonemes [d\u0361z] and [d\u0361\u0292] do not have dedicated letters in the alphabet and are rendered with the digraphs \u0434\u0437 and \u0434\u0436, respectively. [d\u0361z] is equivalent to English ds in pods, [d\u0361\u0292] is equivalent to j in jump.\nAs in Russian, the acute accent may be used to denote vowel stress.\n\nTransliteration\nOrthography\nSpelling search, which began in the late 18th century with the emergence of modern literary language, led to the emergence of several spelling options. In particular, there was the spelling system of Oleksii Pavlovskyi, the spelling version of \"Mermaid of the Dniester\" (1837), Kulishivka (P. Kulish's spelling system), Drahomanivka (produced in Kyiv in the 1870s by a group of cultural figures led by linguist P. Zhytetskyi, which included and M. Drahomanov), Zhelekhivka (system of Yevhen Zhelekhovskyi (1886), enshrined in the Russian Grammar by Smal-Stotskyi and Theodore Gartner 1893).\nBorys Hrinchenko used some corrections in the fundamental four-volume Dictionary of the Ukrainian Language (1907\u20131909). Most of the spelling rules (practically based on phonetics \u2013 \"write as you hear\") used in Hrinchenko's dictionary are still valid. Hrinchenko's work became an informal spelling and model for Ukrainian writers and publications from 1907 until the creation of the first official Ukrainian spelling in 1918.\nOn 17 January 1918, the Central Rada of Ukraine issued the \"Main Rules of Ukrainian orthography\", which, however, did not cover the entire scope of the language. On 17 May 1919, the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences approved the \"Main Rules of Ukrainian Orthography\", which became the basis for all subsequent revisions and amendments.\nOn 23 July 1925, the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR decided to organize a State Commission for the Organization of Ukrainian Spelling (State Spelling Commission). It included more than 20 academics from the USSR, who also expressed a desire to invite representatives of Western Ukraine: Smal-Stotskyi, Volodymyr Hnatiuk and Vasyl Simovych.\nAfter almost a year of work in April 1926, the \"Project of Ukrainian Spelling\" was published to acquaint the general public with the new system. After several months of discussion and consideration of the project at the All-Ukrainian Spelling Conference (26 May \u2013 6 June 1927), the Ukrainian orthography of 1928 was adopted in accordance with the RNC resolution of 6 September 1928. It went down in history as \"Kharkiv\" or \"Skrypnik orthography\" \u2013 from the place of creation, or from the surname of Skrypnyk.\nIn 1929, Hryhorii Holoskevych published the Ukrainian Spelling Dictionary (about 40,000 words), agreed with the full spelling produced by the State Spelling Commission and approved by the People's Commissar for Education (6 September 1928).\nIn 1933, a spelling commission headed by Andrii Khvylia branded the Ukrainian orthography of 1928 as \"nationalist\", immediately stopped publishing any dictionaries, and without any discussion, in a very short time (five months), created a new spelling that unified as never before the Ukrainian and Russian languages. The letter \u0491 was removed from the alphabet, and Ukrainian scientific terminology was revised and harmonized with Russian-Ukrainian dictionaries (the Institute of Ukrainian Scientific Language was abolished in 1930). This version of the spelling was approved by the resolution of the People's Commissar of Education of the USSR of 5 September 1933.\nSome minor changes were made in the spelling of 1946 and 1959 (published the following year). It was connected with the document \"The rules of Russian spelling and punctuation\", published in 1956. From 1960 until 1990, the 1960 edition was the official standard.\nAfter the beginning of \"perestroika\", the issue of improving Ukrainian spelling became relevant again: the editing of the spelling code was started by the Orthographic Commission at the LMM of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The project was also discussed in the newly established Ukrainian Language Society. T. Shevchenko (headed by Dmytro Pavlychko). The new version was approved on 14 November 1989, and published in 1990. The main achievements were the restoration of the letter \u0491 and the accusative case (in Soviet times it was optional and was called the accusative form).\nToday, despite the existence of the official spelling of the Ukrainian language, it is not the only spelling standard in use. Even in Ukraine itself, many publishers and publications use other versions of the spelling, which either tend to \"skrypnykivka\", or else differ from the official rules of transmission of words of foreign origin.\nOn 22 May 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a new version of the orthography prepared by the Ukrainian National Commission on Spelling. The new edition brought to life some features of orthography in 1928, which were part of the Ukrainian orthographic tradition. At the same time, the commission was guided by the understanding that the language practice of Ukrainians in the second half of the 20th to the beginning of the 21st century has already become part of the Ukrainian orthographic tradition.\n\nVocabulary\nThe Dictionary of the Ukrainian Language, in 11 volumes, contains 253,000 entries. Lexical card catalog of the Ukrainian Institute of Language Studies has six million cards. As mentioned at the top of the article, Ukrainian is most closely related lexically to Belarusian, and is also closer to Polish than to Russian (for example, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c, mozhlyvist', \"possibility\", and Polish mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107, but Russian \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, vozmozhnost\u02b9).\n\nFalse cognates with Russian\nThe standard Ukrainian language which is based on the Kyiv\u2013Poltava dialect has a plethora of false friends with the standard Russian language which is based on the dialect of Moscow. Many people intentionally do or do not use them, causing their language shift into what is known as Surzhyk, where the meaning of some words mimicking Russian could be understood out of context rather than their literal meaning in Ukrainian.\n\nClassification\nUkrainian has varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with other Slavic languages. It is closely related to other East Slavic languages with high levels of mutual intelligibility.  Ukrainian is considered to be most closely related to Belarusian.\nThe separation of the East Slavic languages is considered to be relatively recent. In the 19th century, the question of whether the Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages are dialects of a single language or three separate languages was actively discussed, with the debate affected by linguistic and political factors. The political situation (Ukraine and Belarus being mainly part of the Russian Empire at the time) and the historical existence of the medieval state of Kievan Rus', which occupied large parts of these three nations, led to the creation of the common classification known later as the East Slavic languages. The underlying theory of the grouping is their descent from a common ancestor. In modern times, Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian are usually listed by linguists as separate languages.\nThe Ukrainians were predominantly peasants and petits bourgeois. In 1897, 93% of Ukrainians were classified as peasants. As a result, the Ukrainian language was mostly vernacular and few earlier literary works from the period can be found. In the cities, Ukrainian coexisted with Church Slavonic\u2014a literary language of religion that evolved from Old Church Slavonic\u2014and later Polish and Russian, both languages which were more often used in formal writing and communication during that time.\n\nDifferences from other Slavic languages\nThe Ukrainian language has the following similarities with and differences from other Slavic languages:\n\nLike all Slavic languages with the exception of Russian, Belarusian, standard written Slovak and Slovene, the Ukrainian language has preserved the Common Slavic vocative case. When addressing one's sister (sestra) she is referred to as sestro. In the Russian language the vocative case has been almost entirely replaced by the nominative (except for a handful of vestigial forms, e.g. Bozhe \"God!\" and Gospodi \"Lord!\").\nThe Ukrainian language, in common with all Slavic languages other than Russian, Slovak and Slovene, has retained the Common Slavic second palatalization of the velars *k, *g and *x in front of the secondary vowel *\u011b of the dative and locative ending in the female declension, resulting in the final sequences -c\u011b, -z\u011b, and -s\u011b. For example, ruka (hand) becomes ruci in Ukrainian. In Russian, the dative and locative of ruka is ruke.\nThe Ukrainian language, in common with Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, has developed the ending -mo for first-person plurals in verbs (khodymo for \"we walk\"). In all cases, it resulted from lengthening of the Common Slavic -m\u016d.\nThe Ukrainian language, along with Russian and Belarusian, has changed the Common Slavic word-initial ye- into o, such as in the words ozero (lake) and odyn (one).\nThe Ukrainian language, in common with Czech, Slovak, Upper Sorbian, Belarusian and southern Russian dialects, has changed the Common Slavic \"g\" into an \"h\" sound (for example, noha \u2013 leg).\nThe Ukrainian language, in common with some northern Russian and Croatian dialects, has transformed the Common Slavic y\u011b into i (for example, lis \u2013 forest).\nThe Ukrainian language, in common with Russian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, and Slovene, has simplified the Common Slavic tl and dl into l (for example, mela \u2013 she swept\").\nThe Ukrainian language, in common with the most of Slavic ones, is a stress-timed language, in which syllables may last different amounts of time, but there is perceived to be a fairly constant amount of time (on average) between consecutive stressed syllables.\nThe Ukrainian language, in common with all modern Slavic languages other than Bulgarian and Macedonian, does not use articles.\nOther Slavic o in closed syllables, i.e., syllables ending in a consonant, in many cases corresponds to a Ukrainian i, as in pod \u2192 pid (\u043f\u0456\u0434, 'under'). This also includes place names such as Lviv (\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432 in Ukrainian), Lw\u00f3w in Polish, and \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432 (Lvov) in Russian.\nUnlike all other Slavic languages, Ukrainian has a synthetic future (also termed inflectional future) tense which developed through the erosion and cliticization of the verb \"to have\" (or possibly \"to take\"): pysat-ymu (infinitive-future-1st sg.) I will write. Although the inflectional future (based on the verb 'to have') is characteristic of Romance languages, Ukrainian linguist A. Danylenko argues that Ukrainian differs from Romance in the choice of auxiliary, which should be interpreted as 'to take' and not 'to have.' He states that Late Common Slavic (LCS) had three verbs with the same Proto-Indo-European root *h\u2081em-: \n\na determined imperfective LCS *j\u0119ti: *j\u012dm\u01eb 'to take' (later superseded by numerous prefixed perfectives)\nan indetermined imperfective LCS *j\u012dmati: jemlj\u01eb 'to take' (which would not take any prefixes)\nan imperfective LCS *j\u012dm\u011bti: *j\u012dmam\u012d 'to hold, own, have'\nThe three verbs became conflated in East Slavic due to morphological overlap, in particular of *im\u011bti \"to have\" and *jati \"to take\" as exemplified in the Middle Ukrainian homonymic imut\u2019 from both im\u011bti (< *j\u012dm\u011bti) and jati (< *j\u0119ti). Analogous grammaticalization of the type take (\"to take\", \"to seize\") > future is found in Chinese and Hungarian.\n\nSample text\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Ukrainian:\u0412\u0441\u0456 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0443\u044e\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0456 \u0440\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0443 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0457\u0439 \u0433\u0456\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0445. \u0412\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0456\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0456 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044e \u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0456 \u0434\u0456\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0443 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0456 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0434\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0434\u0443\u0441\u0456 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430.The romanization of the text into Latin alphabet:Vsi lyudy narodzhuyut'sya vil'nymy i rivnymy u svoyiy hidnosti ta pravakh.

It is the official language of Andorra, and an official language of three autonomous communities in eastern Spain: Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, where it is called Valencian (valenci\u00e0). It has semi-official status in the Italian comune of Alghero, and it is spoken in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales department of France and in two further areas in eastern Spain: the eastern strip of Aragon and the Carche area in the Region of Murcia. The Catalan-speaking territories are often called the Pa\u00efsos Catalans or \"Catalan Countries\".\nThe language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. Nineteenth-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s.\n\nEtymology and pronunciation\nThe word Catalan is derived from the territorial name of Catalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that Catalunya (Latin: Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia ('Land of the Goths'), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > Catalonia theoretically derived.\nIn English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from Middle French). It is attested a language name since at least 1652. The word Catalan can be pronounced in English as  KAT-\u0259-l\u0259n, -\u2060lan or  KAT-\u0259-LAN.\nThe endonym is pronounced [k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8la] in the Eastern Catalan dialects, and [kata\u02c8la] in the Western dialects. In the Valencian Community and Carche, the term valenci\u00e0 [valensi\u02c8a] is frequently used instead. Thus, the name \"Valencian\", although often employed for referring to the varieties specific to the Valencian Community and Carche, is also used by Valencians as a name for the language as a whole, synonymous with \"Catalan\". Both uses of the term have their respective entries in the dictionaries by the Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL) and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC). (See also status of Valencian below).\n\nHistory\nMiddle Ages\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century onwards the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them. This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988.\nIn the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements, with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080. Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries the Catalan rulers expanded southward to the Ebro river, and in the 13th century they conquered the lands that would become the Kingdoms of Valencia and the Majorca. The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with Catalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.\nIn the Low Middle Ages, Catalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness. Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232\u20131315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th\u201314th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausi\u00e0s March (1397\u20131459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. During this period, the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language. Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th. During this period, the language was what Costa Carreras terms \"one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe\".\nMartorell's novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.\n\nStart of the modern era\nSpain\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon in 1479, the Spanish kings ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and they had to swear by the laws of each territory before the respective parliaments. But after the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain became an absolute monarchy under Philip V, which led to the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Nueva Planta decrees, as a first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state; as in other contemporary European states, this meant the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant groups. Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards national minorities have been a constant.\nThe process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: they \"will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed\". From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate forbidding anyone to \"represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish\". The use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the decline of Catalan. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the nobles, part of the urban and literary classes became bilingual.\n\nFrance\nWith the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of Catalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local Catalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.\nShortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the regional languages of France, such as Catalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.\n\nFrance: 19th to 20th century\nAfter the French colony of Algeria was established in 1830, many Catalan-speaking settlers moved there. People from the Spanish province of Alicante settled around Oran, while those from French Catalonia and Menorca migrated to Algiers.\nBy 1911, there were around 100,000 speakers of Patuet,  as their speech was called. After the Algerian declaration of independence in 1962, almost all the Pied-Noir Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia or Alicante.\nThe French government only recognizes French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the then General Council of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales officially recognized Catalan as one of the d\u00e9partment's languages and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.\n\nSpain: 18th to 20th century\nIn 1807, the Statistics Office of the French Ministry of the Interior asked the prefects for an official survey on the limits of the French language. The survey found that in Roussillon, almost only Catalan was spoken, and since Napoleon wanted to incorporate Catalonia into France, as happened in 1812, the consul in Barcelona was also asked. He declared that Catalan \"is taught in schools, it is printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses\", indicating that it was spoken everywhere \"with the exception of the royal courts\". He also indicated that Catalan was spoken \"in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, Corsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall d \"Aran and Cerda\u00f1a\".\nThe defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of laws which, among other centralizing measures, imposed the use of Spanish in legal documentation all over Spain. Because of this, use of the Catalan language declined into the 18th century.\nHowever, the 19th century saw a Catalan literary revival (Renaixen\u00e7a), which has continued up to the present day. This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimer\u00e0 (drama). In the 19th century, the region of Carche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Valencian speakers. Catalan spelling was standardized in 1913 and the language became official during the Second Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939). The Second Spanish Republic saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against Catalan lifted. The Generalitat (the autonomous government of Catalonia, established during the Republic in 1931) made a normal use of Catalan in its administration and put efforts to promote it at the social level, including in schools and the University of Barcelona.\nThe Catalan language and culture were still vibrant during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939), but were crushed at an unprecedented level throughout the subsequent decades due to Francoist dictatorship (1939\u20131975), which abolished the official status of Catalan and imposed the use of Spanish in schools and in public administration in all of Spain, while banning the use of Catalan in them. Between 1939 and 1943 newspapers and book printing in Catalan almost disappeared. Francisco Franco's desire for a homogeneous Spanish population resonated with some Catalans in favor of his regime, primarily members of the upper class, who began to reject the use of Catalan. Despite all of these hardships, Catalan continued to be used privately within households, and it was able to survive Franco's dictatorship. At the end of World War II, however, some of the harsh measures began to be lifted and, while Spanish language remained the sole promoted one, limited number of Catalan literature began to be tolerated. Several prominent Catalan authors resisted the suppression through literature. Private initiative contests were created to reward works in Catalan, among them Joan Martorell prize (1947), V\u00edctor Catal\u00e0 prize (1953) Carles Riba award (1950), or the Honor Award of Catalan Letters (1969). The first Catalan-language TV show was broadcast in 1964. At the same time, oppression of the Catalan language and identity was carried out in schools, through governmental bodies, and in religious centers.\nIn addition to the loss of prestige for Catalan and its prohibition in schools, migration during the 1950s into Catalonia from other parts of Spain also contributed to the diminished use of the language. These migrants were often unaware of the existence of Catalan, and thus felt no need to learn or use it. Catalonia was the economic powerhouse of Spain, so these migrations continued to occur from all corners of the country. Employment opportunities were reduced for those who were not bilingual. Daily newspapers remained exclusively in Spanish until after Franco's death, when the first one in Catalan since the end of the Civil War, Avui, began to be published in 1976.\n\nPresent day\nSince the Spanish transition to democracy (1975\u20131982), Catalan has been institutionalized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige. In Catalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state linguistic community. The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations\u2014if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students. There is also some intergenerational shift towards Catalan.\nMore recently, several Spanish political forces have tried to increase the use of Spanish in the Catalan educational system. As a result, in May 2022 the Spanish Supreme Court urged the Catalan regional government to enforce a measure by which 25% of all lessons must be taught in Spanish.\nAccording to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, in 2013 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both Catalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with Catalan and 47.5% only Spanish. In 2003 the same studies concluded no language preference for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with Catalan and 47.5% with Spanish. To promote use of Catalan, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories, with entities such as Consorci per a la Normalitzaci\u00f3 Ling\u00fc\u00edstica (Consortium for Linguistic Normalization).\nIn Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language. Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several policies favoring Catalan have been enforced, such as Catalan medium education.\nOn the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In the Northern Catalonia area of France, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.\nIn Alicante province, Catalan is being replaced by Spanish and in Alghero by Italian. There is also well ingrained diglossia in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.\nDuring the 20th century many Catalans emigrated or went into exile to Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and other South American countries. They formed a large number of Catalan colonies that today continue to maintain the Catalan language. They also founded many Catalan casals (associations).\n\nClassification and relationship with other Romance languages\nOne classification of Catalan is given by P\u00e8ire B\u00e8c:\n\nRomance languages\nItalo-Western languages\nWestern Romance languages\nGallo-Iberian languages\nGallo-Romance languages\nOccitano-Romance languages\nCatalan language\nHowever, the ascription of Catalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists and philologists, particularly among Spanish ones, such as Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal.\nCatalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.\n\nRelationship with other Romance languages\nSome include Catalan in Occitan, as the linguistic distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon dialect) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century and still today remains its closest relative.\nCatalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others). However, despite being spoken mostly on the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan has marked differences with the Iberian Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and especially vocabulary; it shows instead its closest affinity with languages native to France and northern Italy, particularly Occitan and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (Franco-Proven\u00e7al, French, Gallo-Italian).\nAccording to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese and Spanish; 76% with Ladin and Romansh; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.\n\nDuring much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939\u20131975), the Catalan language was ridiculed as a mere dialect of Spanish. This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity. Spanish and Catalan have important differences in their sound systems, lexicon, and grammatical features, placing the language in features closer to Occitan (and French).\nThere is evidence that, at least from the 2nd century AD, the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania. Differentiation arose generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galician-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian and Portuguese ferver vs. Catalan bullir, Occitan bolir \"to boil\") and innovatory regionalisms (Spanish novillo, Asturian nuviellu vs. Catalan torell, Occitan taur\u00e8l \"bullock\"), while Catalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.\n\nLike all Romance languages, Catalan has a handful of native words which are unique to it, or rare elsewhere. These include:\n\nverbs: c\u014dnf\u012bgere 'to fasten; transfix' > confegir 'to compose, write up', congemin\u0101re > conjuminar 'to combine, conjugate', de-ex-somnitare > deixondar/-ir 'to wake; awaken', d\u0113ns\u0101re 'to thicken; crowd together' > desar 'to save, keep', \u012bgn\u014dr\u0101re > enyorar 'to miss, yearn, pine for', ind\u0101g\u0101re 'to investigate, track' > Old Catalan enagar 'to incite, induce', odi\u0101re > Old Catalan ujar 'to exhaust, fatigue', p\u0101cific\u0101re > apaivagar 'to appease, mollify', repudi\u0101re > rebutjar 'to reject, refuse';\nnouns: br\u012bsa > brisa 'pomace', buda > boga 'reedmace', catarrhu > cadarn 'catarrh', congesta > congesta 'snowdrift', d\u0113l\u012brium > deler 'ardor, passion', fretu > freu 'brake', l\u0101bem > (a)llau 'avalanche', \u014dra > vora 'edge, border', pistr\u012bce 'sawfish' > pestriu > pestiu 'thresher shark, smooth hound; ray', pr\u016bna 'live coal' > espurna 'spark', tard\u0101ti\u014dnem > tarda\u00f3 > tardor 'autumn'.\nThe Gothic superstrate produced different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan. For example, Catalan fang \"mud\" and rostir \"to roast\", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan filosa \"spinning wheel\" and templa \"temple\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.\nThe same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, Catalan alf\u00e0bia \"large earthenware jar\" and rajola \"tile\", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan oli \"oil\" and oliva \"olive\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna. However, the Arabic element is generally much more prevalent in Spanish.\nSituated between two large linguistic blocks (Iberian Romance and Gallo-Romance), Catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar \"to miss somebody\", apaivagar \"to calm somebody down\", and rebutjar \"reject\".\n\nGeographic distribution\nCatalan-speaking territories\nTraditionally Catalan-speaking territories are sometimes called the Pa\u00efsos Catalans (Catalan Countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.\n\nNumber of speakers\nThe number of people known to be fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 study did not count the total number of speakers, but estimated a total of 9\u20139.5 million by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken. The web site of the Generalitat de Catalunya estimated that as of 2004 there were 9,118,882 speakers of Catalan. These figures only reflect potential speakers; today it is the native language of only 35.6% of the Catalan population. According to Ethnologue, Catalan had 4.1 million native speakers and 5.1 million second-language speakers in 2021.\n\nAccording to a 2011 study the total number of Catalan speakers was over 9.8 million, with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them spoke Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia). Very few Catalan monoglots exist; virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with 99.7% of Catalan speakers in Catalonia able to speak Spanish and 99.9% able to understand it.\nIn Roussillon, only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the Catalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of Catalonia predominantly spoke Catalan at home whereas 52.7% spoke Spanish, 2.8% both Catalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages.\nSpanish was the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. According to 2013 census, Catalan was also very commonly spoken in the city of 1,501,262: it was understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% over the age of two could speak it (1,137,816), 79% could read it (1,246.555), and 53% could write it (835,080). The share of Barcelona residents who could speak it (72.3%) was lower than that of the overall Catalan population, of whom 81.2% over the age of 15 spoke the language. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. An important social characteristic of the Catalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with French in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in Andorra, and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.\n\n1.^  The number of people who understand Catalan includes those who can speak it.\n2.^  Figures relate to all self-declared capable speakers, not just native speakers.\n\nLevel of knowledge\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\nSocial use\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\nNative language\nPhonology\nCatalan phonology varies by dialect. Notable features include:\n\nMarked contrast of the vowel pairs /\u025b, e/ and /\u0254, o/, as in other Western Romance languages, other than Spanish.\nLack of diphthongization of Latin short \u0115, \u014f, as in Galician and Portuguese, but unlike French, Spanish, or Italian.\nAbundance of diphthongs containing /w/, as in Galician and Portuguese.\nIn contrast to other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words, and these may end in a wide variety of consonants, including some consonant clusters. Additionally, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which gives rise to an abundance of such couplets as amic (\"male friend\") vs. amiga (\"female friend\").\nCentral Catalan pronunciation is considered to be standard for the language. The descriptions below are mostly representative of this variety. For the differences in pronunciation between the different dialects, see the section on pronunciation of dialects in this article.\n\nVowels\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, with the exception of Spanish. Balearic also has instances of stressed /\u0259/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /\u025b, e/.\nIn Central Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, \u025b/ > [\u0259]; /o, \u0254, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).\n\nConsonants\nThe consonant system of Catalan is rather conservative.\n\n/l/ has a velarized allophone in syllable coda position in most dialects. However, /l/ is velarized irrespective of position in Eastern dialects such as Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan.\n/v/ occurs in Balearic, Algherese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. It has merged with /b/ elsewhere.\nThe velar nasal /\u014b/ is an allophone of /n/ before /g/ or /k/. However, it has become phonemic in Central dialects that delete the final element of word-final consonant clusters, resulting in minimal pairs such as fan [\u02c8fan] (\u201cthey do\u201d) and fang [\u02c8fa\u014b] (\u201cmud\u201d, pronounced [\u02c8fa\u014bk] in other dialects).\nIn Valencian, the fricative [\u0292] (and [j\u0292]) appears only as a voiced allophone of /\u0283/ (and /j\u0283/) before vowels and voiced consonants; e.g. peix al forn [\u02c8pej\u0292 al \u02c8fo\u027en] ('oven fish'). The /\u0292/ phoneme in other Catalan dialects is pronounced /d\u0292/ in standard Valencian.\nVoiced obstruents undergo final-obstruent devoicing: /b/ > [p], /d/ > [t], /\u0261/ > [k].\nVoiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: /b/ > [\u03b2], /d/ > [\u00f0], /\u0261/ > [\u0263]. Exceptions include /d/ after lateral consonants, and /b/ after /f/. In coda position, these sounds are realized as stops, except in some Valencian dialects where they are lenited.\nThere is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of /\u0283/, /\u0292/, /t\u0283/, /d\u0292/. Some sources describe them as \"postalveolar\". Others as \"back alveolo-palatal\", implying that the characters \u27e8\u0255 \u0291 t\u0255 d\u0291\u27e9 would be more accurate. However, in all literature only the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives are used, even when the same sources use \u27e8\u0255 \u0291\u27e9 for other languages such as Polish and Chinese.\nThe distribution of the two rhotics /r/ and /\u027e/ closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, [r] appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring [\u027e] and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled [r] unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case [\u027e] appears.\nIn careful speech, /n/, /m/, /l/ may be geminated. Geminated /\u028e/ may also occur. Some analyze intervocalic [r] as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme. This is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics.\n\nPhonological evolution\nCatalan shares features with neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, Italian, Sardinian, French, Spanish).\n\nMarked contrast of the vowel pairs /\u025b/ ~ /e/ and /\u0254/ ~ /o/, as in other Western Romance languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.\nLenition of voiced stops [b] \u2192 [\u03b2], [d] \u2192 [\u00f0], [\u0261] \u2192 [\u0263] as in Galician and Spanish.\nLack of diphthongization of Latin short \u0115, \u014f, as in Galician, Sardinian and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.\nAbundance of diphthongs containing /w/, as in Galician and Portuguese.\nAbundance of /\u028e/ and /\u0272/ occurring at the end of words, as for instance moll (\"wet\") and any (\"year\"), unlike Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.\nIn contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic ('male friend') vs. amiga ('female friend').\n\nSociolinguistics\nCatalan sociolinguistics studies the situation of Catalan in the world and the different varieties that this language presents. It is a subdiscipline of Catalan philology and other affine studies and has as an objective to analyze the relation between the Catalan language, the speakers and the close reality (including the one of other languages in contact).\n\nPreferential subjects of study\nDialects of Catalan\nVariations of Catalan by class, gender, profession, age and level of studies\nProcess of linguistic normalization\nRelations between Catalan and Spanish or French\nPerception on the language of Catalan speakers and non-speakers\nPresence of Catalan in several fields: tagging, public function, media, professional sectors\n\nDialects\nOverview\nThe dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%. The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Algherese dialect.\nCatalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern and Western. The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to /\u0259/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.\nWestern Catalan comprises the two dialects of North-Western Catalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: Central Catalan, Balearic, Roussillonese, and Algherese. Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects. The terms \"Catalan\" and \"Valencian\" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) refer to two varieties of the same language. There are two institutions regulating the two standard varieties, the Institute of Catalan Studies in Catalonia and the Valencian Academy of the Language in the Valencian Community.\nCentral Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the largest number of speakers. It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.\nCatalan has an inflectional grammar. Nouns have two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns additionally can have a neuter gender, and some are also inflected for case and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, Catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.\n\nPronunciation\nVowels\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed /\u0259/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /\u025b e/.\nIn Eastern Catalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, \u025b/ > [\u0259]; /o, \u0254, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced [e], [o] in some words. Algherese has lowered [\u0259] to [a].\nIn Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a, e, \u025b/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o, \u0254/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.\nIn Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e, \u025b/ > [e]; /o, \u0254/ > [o]; /a, u, i/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.\nCentral, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /\u025b/. Usually, words with /\u025b/ in Central Catalan correspond to /\u0259/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western Catalan. Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in Central and Western Catalan as well. As a result, Central Catalan has a much higher incidence of /\u025b/.\n\nConsonants\nCatalan dialects are characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition and voicing assimilation. Additionally, many dialects contrast two rhotics (/r, \u027e/) and two laterals ((/l, \u028e/).\nMost Catalan dialects are also renowned by the usage of dark l (i.e. velarization of /l/ \u2192 [\u026b]), which is especially noticeable in syllable final position, in comparison to neighbouring languages, such as Spanish, Italian and French (that lack this pronunciation).\nThere is dialectal variation in regard to:\n\nThe pronunciation and distribution of sibilants (with different results according to voicing and affrication vs. deaffrication).\nWhile, arguably there are seven to eight sibilants in Standard Catalan and Standard Valencian, dialects like Central Valencian and Ribagor\u00e7an only have three or four.\nThe usage of the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme /v/.\nThe pronunciation or not of yod (/j/) in the digraph \u27e8ix\u27e9.\nThe elision and pronunciation of final rhotics (either /\u027e/ or /r/).\nThe delateralization of the palatal lateral approximant (/\u028e/).\nThe alternation of lenition vs. fortition (such as /b/ in poble 'village, people' \u2192 [\u03b2] vs. [b] vs. [b\u02d0] vs. [p] vs. [p\u02d0]).\n\nMorphology\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -e in verbs of the 1st conjugation and -\u2205 in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations in most of the Valencian Community, or -o in all verb conjugations in the Northern Valencian Community and Western Catalonia.E.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western Catalan).\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -o, -i, or -\u2205 in all conjugations. E.g. parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), and parli (Northern), all meaning ('I speak').\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -isc/-esc, -ix, -ixen, -isca/-esca.\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.\nWestern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.E.g. h\u00f2mens 'men', j\u00f3vens 'youth'.\nEastern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, loss of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.E.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth' (Ibicencan, however, follows the model of Western Catalan in this case).\n\nVocabulary\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nStandards\nStandard Catalan, virtually accepted by all speakers, is mostly based on Eastern Catalan, which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian Community and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.\nThe most notable difference between both standards is some tonic \u27e8e\u27e9 accentuation, for instance: franc\u00e8s, angl\u00e8s (IEC) \u2013 franc\u00e9s, angl\u00e9s (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, while pronouncing it as /e/ rather than /\u025b/, in some words such as: qu\u00e8 ('what'), or Val\u00e8ncia. Other divergences include the use of \u27e8tl\u27e9 (AVL) in some words instead of \u27e8tll\u27e9 like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, such as subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').\nIn the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the Balearic Islands's philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing'), but the university says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be cantam in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').\nIn Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the Algherese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou/la sua ('his/her'), lo tou/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- /v/ in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Algherese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of alg\u00fa ('someone'), qual/quala instead of quin/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns. In 1999, Catalan (Algherese dialect) was among the twelve minority languages officially recognized as Italy's \"historical linguistic minorities\" by the Italian State under Law No. 482/1999.\nIn 2011, the Aragonese government passed a decree approving the statutes of a new language regulator of Catalan in La Franja (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon) as originally provided for by Law 10/2009. The new entity, designated as Institut Aragon\u00e8s del Catal\u00e0, shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in La Franja.\n\nStatus of Valencian\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (provinces of Lleida and the western half of Tarragona). Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian.\nLinguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and Catalan varieties.\n\nThe AVL, created by the Valencian parliament, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on the Norms of Castell\u00f3 (Normes de Castell\u00f3). Currently, everyone who writes in Valencian uses this standard, except the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acad\u00e8mia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses an independent standard for Valencian.\nDespite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan. This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acad\u00e8mia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan.\nThis clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European Constitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.\n\nVocabulary\nWord choices\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\nLiterary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others.\n\nLatin and Greek loanwords\nLike other languages, Catalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work. In the 14th and 15th centuries Catalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in Ro\u00eds de Corella's writings. The incorporation of learned, or \"bookish\" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, into Catalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Catalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing\u2014and eventually speech\u2014in Catalan.\n\nWord formation\nThe process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where inflection is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example el\u00e8ctric [\u0259\u02c8l\u025bktrik] (\"electrical\") vs. electricitat [\u0259l\u0259ktrisi\u02c8tat]. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure (\"foresee\").\nThere is greater regularity in the process of word-compounding, where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.\n\nWriting system\nCatalan uses the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The Catalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardization of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC, founded in 1911) published the Normes ortogr\u00e0fiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castell\u00f3 de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de Castell\u00f3, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's Catalan language norms.\n\nGrammar\nThe grammar of Catalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:\n\nUse of definite and indefinite articles.\nNouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.\nVerbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).\nThere are no modal auxiliaries.\nWord order is freer than in English.\n\nGender and number inflection\nIn gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a, has been replaced by \u00f8/-a. There are only a few exceptions, such as minso/minsa (\"scarce\"). Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:\n\nAffrication: boig/boja (\"insane\") vs. lleig/lletja (\"ugly\")\nLoss of n: pla/plana (\"flat\") vs. segon/segona (\"second\")\nFinal obstruent devoicing: sentit/sentida (\"felt\") vs. dit/dita (\"said\")\nCatalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi/noia (\"boy\"/\"girl\") and gall/gallina (\"cock\"/\"hen\"), whereas French has gar\u00e7on/fille and coq/poule.\nThere is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favor of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta (\"boiling\") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.\nAs in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely. The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols/els polsos (\"the pulse\"/\"the pulses\") vs. la pols/les pols (\"the dust\"/\"the dusts\").\n\nDeterminers\nThe inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages. Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, such as dels (\"of + the [plural]\"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).\nCentral Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favor of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.\n\nPersonal pronouns\nThe morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, especially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).\nCatalan pronouns exhibit T\u2013V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not Modern English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a \u00e9l. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).\n\nVerbs\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.\nThe Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar (\"to go\") + infinitive.\nCatalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.\n\nSyntax\nThe grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject\u2013verb\u2013object. However, word order is very flexible. Commonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence \"The train has arrived\" could be translated as Ha arribat el tren or El tren ha arribat. Both sentences mean \"the train has arrived\", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. This subtle distinction is described as \"what you might say while waiting in the station\" versus \"what you might say on the train\".\n\nCatalan names\nIn Spain, every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname. The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction i (\"and\").\n\nSample text\nSelected text from Manuel de Pedrolo's 1970 novel Un amor fora ciutat (\"A love affair outside the city\").\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\nExternal links\nInstitutions\n\nConsorci per a la Normalitzaci\u00f3 Ling\u00fc\u00edstica\nInstitut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC)\nAcad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL)\nAbout the Catalan/Valencian language\n\nGram\u00e0tica de la Llengua Catalana (Catalan grammar), from the Institut d'Estudis Catalans\nGram\u00e0tica Normativa Valenciana (Valencian grammar).

It is also spoken in northeast Iran, as well as in certain areas of Armenia and Azerbaijan. \nKurdish varieties constitute a dialect continuum, with some mutually unintelligible varieties, and collectively have 26 million native speakers. The main varieties of Kurdish are Kurmanji, Sorani, and Southern Kurdish (Xwar\u00een). The majority of the Kurds speak Kurmanji, and most Kurdish texts are written in Kurmanji and Sorani. Kurmanji is written in the Hawar alphabet, a derivation of the Latin script, and Sorani is written in the Sorani alphabet, a derivation of the Arabic script.\nA separate group of non-Kurdish Northwestern Iranian languages, the Zaza\u2013Gorani languages, are also spoken by several million ethnic Kurds.\nThe classification of Laki as a dialect of Southern Kurdish or as a fourth language under Kurdish is a matter of debate, but the differences between Laki and other Southern Kurdish dialects are minimal.\nThe literary output in Kurdish was mostly confined to poetry until the early 20th century, when more general literature became developed. Today, the two principal written Kurdish dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani. Sorani is, along with Arabic, one of the two official languages of Iraq and is in political documents simply referred to as \"Kurdish\".\n\nClassification and origin\nThe Kurdish varieties belong to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family. They are generally classified as Northwestern Iranian languages, or by some scholars as intermediate between Northwestern and Southwestern Iranian.:\u200a587\u200a Martin van Bruinessen notes that \"Kurdish has a strong South-Western Iranian element\", whereas \"Zaza and Gurani [...] do belong to the north-west Iranian group\".\nLudwig Paul concludes that Kurdish seems to be a Northwestern Iranian language in origin, but acknowledges that it shares many traits with Southwestern Iranian languages like Persian, apparently due to longstanding and intense historical contacts.\nWindfuhr identified Kurdish dialects as Parthian, albeit with a Median substratum. Windfuhr and Frye assume an eastern origin for Kurdish and consider it as related to eastern and central Iranian dialects.\nThe present state of knowledge about Kurdish allows, at least roughly, drawing the approximate borders of the areas where the main ethnic core of the speakers of the contemporary Kurdish dialects was formed. The most argued hypothesis on the localisation of the ethnic territory of the Kurds remains D.N. Mackenzie's theory, proposed in the early 1960s (Mackenzie 1961). Developing the ideas of P. Tedesco (1921: 255) and regarding the common phonetic isoglosses shared by Kurdish, Persian, and Baluchi, Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages may once have been in closer contact.\n\nVarieties\nKurdish varieties are divided into three or four groups, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.\n\nKurmanji is the largest dialect group, spoken by an estimated 15 to 20 million Kurds in Turkey, Syria, northern Iraq, and northwest and northeast Iran.\nSorani is spoken by an estimated 6 to 7 million Kurds in much of Iraqi Kurdistan and the Iranian Kurdistan province. Sorani is a written standard of Central Kurdish developed in the 1920s (named after the historical Soran Emirate) and was later adopted as the standard orthography of Kurdish as an official language of Iraq.\nSouthern Kurdish (Pehlewani) is spoken in the Kermanshah, Ilam and Lorestan provinces of Iran and in the Khanaqin District of eastern Iraq. Laki and Kordali (Palai) are often included in Southern Kurdish, but they have some distinct features.\nIn historical evolution terms, Kurmanji is less modified than Sorani and Pehlewani in both phonetic and morphological structure. The Sorani group has been influenced by among other things its closer cultural proximity to the other languages spoken by Kurds in the region including the Gorani language in parts of Iranian Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan.\nPhilip G. Kreyenbroek, an expert writing in 1992, says:\n\nSince 1932 most Kurds have used the Roman script to write Kurmanji.... Sorani is normally written in an adapted form of the Arabic script.... Reasons for describing Kurmanji and Sorani as 'dialects' of one language are their common origin and the fact that this usage reflects the sense of ethnic identity and unity among the Kurds. From a linguistic or at least a grammatical point of view, however, Kurmanji and Sorani differ as much from each other as English and German, and it would seem appropriate to refer to them as languages. For example, Sorani has neither gender nor case-endings, whereas Kurmanji has both.... Differences in vocabulary and pronunciation are not as great as between German and English, but they are still considerable.\nAccording to Encyclopaedia of Islam, although Kurdish is not a unified language, its many dialects are interrelated and at the same time distinguishable from other Western Iranian languages. The same source classifies different Kurdish dialects as two main groups, northern and central. The average Kurmanji speaker does not find it easy to communicate with the inhabitants of Sulaymaniyah or Halabja.\nSome linguistic scholars assert that the term \"Kurdish\" has been applied extrinsically in describing the language the Kurds speak, whereas some ethnic Kurds have used the word term to simply describe their ethnicity and refer to their language as Kurmanji, Sorani, Hewrami, Kermanshahi, Kalhori or whatever other dialect or language they speak. Some historians have noted that it is only recently that the Kurds who speak the Sorani dialect have begun referring to their language as Kurd\u00ee, in addition to their identity, which is translated to simply mean Kurdish.\nThe Mokriani variety of Sorani is widely spoken in Mokrian. Piranshahr and Mahabad are two principal cities of the Mokrian area.\n\nZazaki and Gorani\nZaza\u2013Gorani languages, which are spoken by communities in the wider area who identify as ethnic Kurds, are not linguistically classified as Kurdish. Zaza-Gorani is classified as adjunct to Kurdish, although authorities differ in the details.:\u200a589\u200a groups Kurdish with Zaza Gorani within a \"Northwestern I\" group, while Glottolog based on Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica prefers an areal grouping of \"Central dialects\" (or \"Kermanic\") within Northwest Iranic, with Kurdish but not Zaza-Gorani grouped with \"Kermanic\".\nGorani is distinct from Northern and Central Kurdish, yet shares vocabulary with both of them and there are some grammatical similarities with Central Kurdish. The Hawrami dialects of Gorani includes a variety that was an important literary language since the 14th century, but it was replaced by Central Kurdish in the 20th century.\nEuropean scholars have maintained that Gorani is separate from Kurdish and that Kurdish is synonymous with the Northern Kurdish group, whereas ethnic Kurds maintain that Kurdish encompasses any of the unique languages or dialects spoken by Kurds that are not spoken by neighbouring ethnic groups.\nGorani is classified as part of the Zaza\u2013Gorani branch of Indo-Iranian languages. The Zaza language, spoken mainly in Turkey, differs both grammatically and in vocabulary and is generally not understandable by Gorani speakers but it is considered related to Gorani. Almost all Zaza-speaking communities, as well as speakers of the closely related Shabaki dialect spoken in parts of Iraqi Kurdistan, identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.\nGeoffrey Haig and Ergin \u00d6pengin in their recent study suggest grouping the Kurdish languages into Northern Kurdish, Central Kurdish, Southern Kurdish, Zaza, and Gorani, and avoid the subgrouping Zaza\u2013Gorani.\nProfessor Zare Yusupova has carried out much work and research into the Gorani dialect (as well as many other minority/ancient Kurdish dialects).\n\nHistory\nDuring his stay in Damascus, historian Ibn Wahshiyya came across two books on agriculture written in Kurdish, one on the culture of the vine and the palm tree, and the other on water and the means of finding it out in unknown ground. He translated both from Kurdish into Arabic in the early 9th century AD.\nAmong the earliest Kurdish religious texts is the Yazidi Black Book, the sacred book of Yazidi faith. It is considered to have been authored sometime in the 13th century AD by Hassan bin Adi (b. 1195 AD), the great-grandnephew of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir (d. 1162), the founder of the faith. It contains the Yazidi account of the creation of the world, the origin of man, the story of Adam and Eve and the major prohibitions of the faith. According to The Cambridge History of the Kurds, \"the first proper 'text'\" written in Kurdish is a short Christian prayer. It was written in Armenian characters, and dates from the fifteenth century. From the 15th to 17th centuries, classical Kurdish poets and writers developed a literary language. The most notable classical Kurdish poets from this period were Ali Hariri, Ahmad Khani, Malaye Jaziri and Faqi Tayran.\nThe Italian priest Maurizio Garzoni published the first Kurdish grammar titled Grammatica e Vocabolario della Lingua Kurda in Rome in 1787 after eighteen years of missionary work among the Kurds of Amadiya. This work is very important in Kurdish history as it is the first acknowledgment of the widespread use of a distinctive Kurdish language. Garzoni was given the title Father of Kurdology by later scholars. The Kurdish language was banned in a large portion of Kurdistan for some time. After the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat until 1991 the use of the Kurdish language was illegal in Turkey.\n\nCurrent status\nToday, Sorani is an official language in Iraq. In Syria, on the other hand, publishing materials in Kurdish is forbidden, though this prohibition is not enforced any more due to the Syrian civil war.\nBefore August 2002, the Turkish government placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media. In March 2006, Turkey allowed private television channels to begin airing programming in Kurdish. However, the Turkish government said that they must avoid showing children's cartoons, or educational programs that teach Kurdish, and could broadcast only for 45 minutes a day or four hours a week. The state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) started its 24-hour Kurdish television station on 1 January 2009 with the motto \"we live under the same sky\". The Turkish prime minister sent a video message in Kurdish to the opening ceremony, which was attended by Minister of Culture and other state officials. The channel uses the X, W, and Q letters during broadcasting. However, most of these restrictions on private Kurdish television channels were relaxed in September 2009. In 2010, Kurdish municipalities in the southeast began printing marriage certificates, water bills, construction and road signs, as well as emergency, social and cultural notices in Kurdish alongside Turkish. Also Imams began to deliver Friday sermons in Kurdish and Esnaf price tags in Kurdish. Many mayors were tried for issuing public documents in Kurdish language. The Kurdish alphabet is not recognized in Turkey, and prior to 2013 the use of Kurdish names containing the letters X, W, and Q, which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet, was not allowed. In 2012, Kurdish-language lessons became an elective subject in public schools. Previously, Kurdish education had only been possible in private institutions.\nIn Iran, though it is used in some local media and newspapers, it is not used in public schools. In 2005, 80 Syrian and Iranian Kurds took part in an experiment and gained scholarships to study in Kurdistan Region, Iraq, in their native tongue.\nIn Kyrgyzstan, 96.21% of the Kurdish population speak Kurdish as their native language. In Kazakhstan, the corresponding percentage is 88.7%.\n\nPhonology\nGrammar\nWriting system\nSee also\nKurdish people\nKurdish culture\nKurdish literature\nKurdish Institute of Paris\nKurdish Institute of Istanbul\nList of countries by Kurdish-speaking population\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nW\u00eek\u00eeferheng Archived 31 October 2015 at the Wayback Machine (Kurdish Wiktionary)\nVejinBooks, collection of Kurdish literary and historical texts\nVejin Dictionaries, collection of Kurdish dictionaries (written in Arabic script)\nThe Kurdish Academy of Language (unofficial)\nKurd\u00een\u00fbs, a tool for writing in Kurdish and to convert texts from Arabic script to Latin script and vice versa Archived 30 November 2021 at the Wayback Machine\nEger\u00een, Kurdish (Kurmanji) search engine\ninKurdish: English\u2013Kurdish Translation\nDictio: English\u2013Kurdish (Sorani) Dictionary\nThe Kurdish Institute of Paris: Language and Literature\nKurdish Language and Linguistics, at Encyclopedia Iranica (article written by Ludwig Paul)\nReference Grammar with Selected Readings both for Sorani and Kurmanji, written by W.

Here is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article on the Kurdish language:\n\n### Dialects and Varieties\n1. **Main Dialects**:\n   - **Kurmanji**: Spoken by 15 to 20 million Kurds in Turkey, Syria, northern Iraq, and northwest and northeast Iran. It is written in the Hawar alphabet, a derivation of the Latin script.\n   - **Sorani**: Spoken by 6 to 7 million Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Iranian Kurdistan province. It is written in the Sorani alphabet, a derivation of the Arabic script. Sorani lacks gender and case-endings, unlike Kurmanji.\n   - **Southern Kurdish (Pehlewani)**: Spoken in the Kermanshah, Ilam, and Lorestan provinces of Iran and in the Khanaqin District of eastern Iraq. Laki and Kordali (Palai) are often included in this group.\n\n2. **Zaza\u2013Gorani Languages**:\n   - These are not linguistically classified as Kurdish but are spoken by ethnic Kurds. Gorani shares vocabulary with Northern and Central Kurdish and has some grammatical similarities with Central Kurdish.\n\n### Writing Systems\n- **Kurmanji**: Uses the Hawar alphabet (Latin script).\n- **Sorani**: Uses the Sorani alphabet (Arabic script).\n- **Gorani**: Historically used for literary purposes but replaced by Central Kurdish in the 20th century.\n\n### Grammar and Linguistic Features\n- **Kurmanji**: Has gender and case-endings, making it grammatically distinct from Sorani.\n- **Sorani**: Lacks gender and case-endings, which simplifies certain grammatical structures compared to Kurmanji.\n- **Gorani**: Shares some grammatical similarities with Central Kurdish.\n\n### Historical Context\n- The Kurdish language has a rich literary history, with classical poets like Ali Hariri, Ahmad Khani, Malaye Jaziri, and Faqi Tayran contributing to its development.\n- The first Kurdish grammar was published by Maurizio Garzoni in 1787, marking a significant acknowledgment of the Kurdish language.\n\n### Current Status and Usage\n- **Iraq**: Sorani is an official language.\n- **Turkey**: Kurdish broadcasting is allowed, but with restrictions. The Kurdish alphabet is not officially recognized, and Kurdish education is limited to private institutions.\n- **Syria**: Publishing in Kurdish is technically forbidden, though not enforced due to the civil war.\n- **Iran**: Kurdish is used in local media but not in public schools.\n\n### Resources for Translators\n- **Kurdish Wiktionary**: A resource for Kurdish vocabulary.\n- **VejinBooks and Vejin Dictionaries**: Collections of Kurdish literary and historical texts and dictionaries.\n- **Kurd\u00een\u00fbs**: A tool for writing in Kurdish and converting texts between Arabic and Latin scripts.\n- **inKurdish and Dictio**: Online translation and dictionary resources for English-Kurdish (Sorani).\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The Kurdish language has been influenced by historical contacts with Persian and other regional languages, which may affect vocabulary and syntax.\n- The classification of Kurdish dialects varies, with some scholars grouping them differently based on linguistic features.\n\nThis comprehensive understanding of the Kurdish language, its dialects, writing systems, and historical context will be invaluable for anyone attempting to translate text into Kurdish.", "updated": "2025-03-04T17:03:47.669889"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language": {"base_content": "Thai, or Central Thai (historically Siamese; Thai: \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22), is a Tai language of the Kra\u2013Dai language family spoken by the Central Thai, Mon, Lao Wiang, Phuan people in Central Thailand and the vast majority of Thai Chinese enclaves throughout the country. It is the sole official language of Thailand.\nThai is the most spoken of over 60 languages of Thailand by both number of native and overall speakers. Over half of its vocabulary is derived from or borrowed from Pali, Sanskrit, Mon and Old Khmer. It is a tonal and analytic language. Thai has a complex orthography and system of relational markers. Spoken Thai, depending on standard sociolinguistic factors such as age, gender, class, spatial proximity, and the urban/rural divide, is partly mutually intelligible with Lao, Isan, and some fellow Thai topolects. These languages are written with slightly different scripts, but are linguistically similar and effectively form a dialect continuum.\nThai language is spoken by over 69 million people (2020). Moreover, most Thais in the northern (Lanna) and the northeastern (Isan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects because Central Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media. A recent research found that the speakers of the Northern Thai language (also known as Phasa Mueang or Kham Mueang) have become so few, as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak Standard Thai, so that they are now using mostly Central Thai words and only seasoning their speech with the \"Kham Mueang\" accent. Standard Thai is based on the register of the educated classes by Central Thai and ethnic minorities in the area along the ring surrounding the Metropolis.\nIn addition to Central Thai, Thailand is home to other related Tai languages. Although most linguists classify these dialects as related but distinct languages, native speakers often identify them as regional variants or dialects of the \"same\" Thai language, or as \"different kinds of Thai\". As a dominant language in all aspects of society in Thailand, Thai initially saw gradual and later widespread adoption as a second language among the country's minority ethnic groups from the mid-late Ayutthaya period onward. Ethnic minorities today are predominantly bilingual, speaking Thai alongside their native language or dialect.\n\nClassification\nStandard Thai is classified as one of the Chiang Saen languages\u2014others being Northern Thai, Southern Thai and numerous smaller languages, which together with the Northwestern Tai and Lao-Phutai languages, form the Southwestern branch of Tai languages. The Tai languages are a branch of the Kra\u2013Dai language family, which encompasses a large number of indigenous languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Guangxi south through Laos and Northern Vietnam to the Cambodian border.\nStandard Thai is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout Thailand. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai script.\n\nHistory\nThai has undergone various historical sound changes. Some of the most significant changes occurred during the evolution from Old Thai to modern Thai. The Thai writing system has an eight-century history and many of these changes, especially in consonants and tones, are evidenced in the modern orthography.\n\nEarly spread\nAccording to a Chinese source, during the Ming dynasty, Yingya Shenglan (1405\u20131433), Ma Huan reported on the language of the Xi\u0101nlu\u00f3 (\u66b9\u7f85) or Ayutthaya Kingdom, saying that it somewhat resembled the local patois as pronounced in Guangdong:\u200a107\u200a Ayutthaya, the old capital of Thailand from 1351 - 1767 A.D., was from the beginning a bilingual society, speaking Thai and Khmer. Bilingualism must have been strengthened and maintained for some time by the great number of Khmer-speaking captives the Thais took from Angkor Thom after their victories in 1369, 1388 and 1431. Gradually toward the end of the period, a language shift took place. Khmer fell out of use. Both Thai and Khmer descendants whose great-grand parents or earlier ancestors were bilingual came to use only Thai. In the process of language shift, an abundance of Khmer elements were transferred into Thai and permeated all aspects of the language. Consequently, the Thai of the late Ayutthaya Period which later became Ratanakosin or Bangkok Thai, was a thorough mixture of Thai and Khmer. There were more Khmer words in use than Tai cognates. Khmer grammatical rules were used actively to coin new disyllabic and polysyllabic words and phrases. Khmer expressions, sayings, and proverbs were expressed in Thai through transference.\nThais borrowed both the Royal vocabulary and rules to enlarge the vocabulary from Khmer. The Thais later developed the royal vocabulary according to their immediate environment. Thai and Pali, the latter from Theravada Buddhism, were added to the vocabulary. An investigation of the Ayutthaya Rajasap reveals that three languages, Thai, Khmer and Khmero-Indic were at work closely both in formulaic expressions and in normal discourse. In fact, Khmero-Indic may be classified in the same category as Khmer because Indic had been adapted to the Khmer system first before the Thai borrowed.\n\nOld Thai\nOld Thai had a three-way tone distinction on \"live syllables\" (those not ending in a stop), with no possible distinction on \"dead syllables\" (those ending in a stop, i.e. either /p/, /t/, /k/ or the glottal stop that automatically closes syllables otherwise ending in a short vowel).\nThere was a two-way voiced vs. voiceless distinction among all fricative and sonorant consonants, and up to a four-way distinction among stops and affricates. The maximal four-way occurred in labials (/p p\u02b0 b \u0294b/) and denti-alveolars (/t t\u02b0 d \u0294d/); the three-way distinction among velars (/k k\u02b0 \u0261/) and palatals (/t\u0255 t\u0255\u02b0 d\u0291/), with the glottalized member of each set apparently missing.\nThe major change between old and modern Thai was due to voicing distinction losses and the concomitant tone split. This may have happened between about 1300 and 1600 CE, possibly occurring at different times in different parts of the Thai-speaking area. All voiced\u2013voiceless pairs of consonants lost the voicing distinction:\n\nPlain voiced stops (/b d \u0261 d\u0291/) became voiceless aspirated stops (/p\u02b0 t\u02b0 k\u02b0 t\u0255\u02b0/).\nVoiced fricatives became voiceless.\nVoiceless sonorants became voiced.\nHowever, in the process of these mergers, the former distinction of voice was transferred into a new set of tonal distinctions. In essence, every tone in Old Thai split into two new tones, with a lower-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiced consonant, and a higher-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiceless consonant (including glottalized stops). An additional complication is that formerly voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates (original /p t k t\u0255 \u0294b \u0294d/) also caused original tone 1 to lower, but had no such effect on original tones 2 or 3.\nThe above consonant mergers and tone splits account for the complex relationship between spelling and sound in modern Thai. Modern \"low\"-class consonants were voiced in Old Thai, and the terminology \"low\" reflects the lower tone variants that resulted. Modern \"mid\"-class consonants were voiceless unaspirated stops or affricates in Old Thai\u2014precisely the class that triggered lowering in original tone 1 but not tones 2 or 3. Modern \"high\"-class consonants were the remaining voiceless consonants in Old Thai (voiceless fricatives, voiceless sonorants, voiceless aspirated stops). The three most common tone \"marks\" (the lack of any tone mark, as well as the two marks termed mai ek and mai tho) represent the three tones of Old Thai, and the complex relationship between tone mark and actual tone is due to the various tonal changes since then. Since the tone split, the tones have changed in actual representation to the point that the former relationship between lower and higher tonal variants has been completely obscured. Furthermore, the six tones that resulted after the three tones of Old Thai were split have since merged into five in standard Thai, with the lower variant of former tone 2 merging with the higher variant of former tone 3, becoming the modern \"falling\" tone.\n\nOld Thai (Sukhothai) consonant inventory\nHistorical Sukhothai pronuncation\nEarly Old Thai\nEarly Old Thai also apparently had velar fricatives /x \u0263/ as distinct phonemes. These were represented by the now-obsolete letters \u0e03 kho khuat and \u0e05 kho khon, respectively. During the Old Thai period, these sounds merged into the corresponding stops /k\u02b0 \u0261/, and as a result the use of these letters became unstable.\nAt some point in the history of Thai, an alveolo-palatal nasal phoneme /\u0272/ also existed, inherited from Proto-Tai. A letter \u0e0d yo ying also exists, which is used to represent an alveolo-palatal nasal in words borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali, and is currently pronounced /j/ at the beginning of a syllable but /n/ at the end of a syllable.  Most native Thai words that are reconstructed as beginning with /\u0272/ are also pronounced /j/ in modern Thai, but generally spelled with \u0e22 yo yak, which consistently represents /j/. This suggests that /\u0272/ > /j/ in native words occurred in the pre-literary period. It is unclear whether Sanskrit and Pali words beginning with /\u0272/ were borrowed directly with a /j/, or whether a /\u0272/ was re-introduced, followed by a second change /\u0272/ > /j/. The northeastern Thai dialect Isan and the Lao language still preserve the phoneme /\u0272/, which is represented in the Lao script by  \u0e8d, such as in the word  \u0e8d\u0eb8\u0e87 (/\u0272\u00fa\u014b/, mosquito). This letter is distinct from the phoneme /j/ and its Lao letter \u0ea2, such as in the word  \u0ea2\u0eb2 (/j\u00e0\u02d0/, medicine). The distinction in writing has been lost in the informal writing of the Isan language with the Thai script and both sounds are represented by \u0e22 /j/ (See: Comparison of Lao and Isan).\nProto-Tai also had a glottalized palatal sound, reconstructed as /\u0294j/ in Li Fang-Kuei (1977). Corresponding Thai words are generally spelled \u0e2b\u0e22, which implies an Old Thai pronunciation of /hj/ (or /j\u030a/), but a few such words are spelled \u0e2d\u0e22, which implies a pronunciation of /\u0294j/ and suggests that the glottalization may have persisted through to the early literary period.\n\nVowel developments\nThe vowel system of modern Thai contains nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each of which can occur short or long. According to Li (1977), however, many Thai dialects have only one such short\u2013long pair (/a a\u02d0/), and in general it is difficult or impossible to find minimal short\u2013long pairs in Thai that involve vowels other than /a/ and where both members have frequent correspondences throughout the Tai languages.  More specifically, he notes the following facts about Thai:\n\nIn open syllables, only long vowels occur. (This assumes that all apparent cases of short open syllables are better described as ending in a glottal stop.  This makes sense from the lack of tonal distinctions in such syllables, and the glottal stop is also reconstructible across the Tai languages.)\nIn closed syllables, the long high vowels /i\u02d0 \u026f\u02d0 u\u02d0/ are rare, and cases that do exist typically have diphthongs in other Tai languages.\nIn closed syllables, both short and long mid /e e\u02d0 o o\u02d0/ and low /\u025b \u025b\u02d0 \u0254 \u0254\u02d0/ do occur.  However, generally, only words with short /e o/ and long /\u025b\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0/ are reconstructible back to Proto-Tai.\nBoth of the mid back unrounded vowels /\u0264 \u0264\u02d0/ are rare, and words with such sounds generally cannot be reconstructed back to Proto-Tai.\nFurthermore, the vowel that corresponds to short Thai /a/ has a different and often higher quality in many of the Tai languages compared with the vowel corresponding to Thai /a\u02d0/.\nThis leads Li to posit the following:\n\nProto-Tai had a system of nine pure vowels with no length distinction, and possessing approximately the same qualities as in modern Thai: high /i \u026f u/, mid /e \u0264 o/, low /\u025b a \u0254/.\nAll Proto-Tai vowels were lengthened in open syllables, and low vowels were also lengthened in closed syllables.\nModern Thai largely preserved the original lengths and qualities, but lowered /\u0264/ to /a/, which became short /a/ in closed syllables and created a phonemic length distinction /a a\u02d0/.  Eventually, length in all other vowels became phonemic as well and a new /\u0264/ (both short and long) was introduced, through a combination of borrowing and sound change.  Li believes that the development of long /i\u02d0 \u026f\u02d0 u\u02d0/ from diphthongs, and the lowering of /\u0264/ to /a/ to create a length distinction /a a\u02d0/, had occurred by the time of Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but the other missing modern Thai vowels had not yet developed.\nNot all researchers agree with Li. Pittayaporn (2009), for example, reconstructs a similar system for Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but believes that there was also a mid back unrounded vowel /\u0259/ (which he describes as /\u0264/), occurring only before final velar /k \u014b/.  He also seems to believe that the Proto-Southwestern-Tai vowel length distinctions can be reconstructed back to similar distinctions in Proto-Tai.\n\nPhonology\nConsonants\nInitials\nStandard Thai distinguishes three voice-onset times among plosive and affricate consonants:\n\nvoiced\ntenuis (unvoiced, unaspirated)\naspirated\nWhere English makes a distinction between voiced /b/ and unvoiced aspirated /p\u02b0/, Thai distinguishes a third sound \u2013 the unvoiced, unaspirated /p/ that occurs in English only as an allophone of /p\u02b0/, for example after an /s/ as in the sound of the p in \"spin\". There is similarly a laminal denti-alveolar /d/, /t/, /t\u02b0/ triplet in Thai. In the velar series there is a /k/, /k\u02b0/ pair and in the postalveolar series a /t\u0255/, /t\u0255\u02b0/ pair, without the corresponding voiced sounds /\u0261/ and /d\u0291/. (In loanwords from English, English /\u0261/ and /d\u0361\u0292/ are borrowed as the tenuis stops /k/ and /t\u0255/.)\nIn each cell below, the first line indicates International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation). The letter \u0e2b, one of the two h letters, is also used to help write certain tones (described below).\n\nFinals\nAlthough the overall 44 Thai consonant letters provide 21 sounds in case of initials, the case for finals is different. For finals, only eight sounds, as well as no sound, called m\u0101tr\u0101 (\u0e21\u0e32\u0e15\u0e23\u0e32) are used. To demonstrate, at the end of a syllable, \u0e1a (/b/) and \u0e14 (/d/) are devoiced, becoming pronounced as /p/ and /t/ respectively. Additionally, all plosive sounds are unreleased. Hence, final /p/, /t/, and /k/ sounds are pronounced as [p\u031a], [t\u031a], and [k\u031a] respectively.\nOf the consonant letters, excluding the disused \u0e03 and \u0e05, six (\u0e09 \u0e1c \u0e1d \u0e2b \u0e2d \u0e2e) cannot be used as a final and the other 36 are grouped as following.\n\nClusters\nIn Thai, each syllable in a word is articulated independently, so consonants from adjacent syllables (i.e. heterosyllabic) show no sign of articulation as a cluster. Thai has specific phonotactical patterns that describe its syllable structure, including tautosyllabic consonant clusters, and vowel sequences. In core Thai words (i.e. excluding loanwords), only clusters of two consonants occur, of which there are 11 combinations:\n\n/kr/ (\u0e01\u0e23), /kl/ (\u0e01\u0e25), /kw/ (\u0e01\u0e27)\n/k\u02b0r/ (\u0e02\u0e23, \u0e04\u0e23), /k\u02b0l/ (\u0e02\u0e25, \u0e04\u0e25), /k\u02b0w/ (\u0e02\u0e27, \u0e04\u0e27)\n/pr/ (\u0e1b\u0e23), /pl/ (\u0e1b\u0e25)\n/p\u02b0r/ (\u0e1e\u0e23), /p\u02b0l/ (\u0e1c\u0e25, \u0e1e\u0e25)\n/tr/ (\u0e15\u0e23)\nThe number of clusters increases in loanwords such as /t\u02b0r/ (\u0e17\u0e23) in \u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32 (/\u0294\u012bn.t\u02b0r\u0101\u02d0/, from Sanskrit indr\u0101) or /fr/ (\u0e1f\u0e23) in \u0e1f\u0e23\u0e35 (/fr\u012b\u02d0/, from English free); however, these usually only occur in initial position, with either /r/, /l/, or /w/ as the second consonant sound and not more than two sounds at a time.\n\nVowels\nThe vowel nuclei of the Thai language are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the International Phonetic Alphabet, the second entry gives the spelling in the Thai script, where a dash (\u2013) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant follows.\n\nEach vowel quality occurs in long-short pairs: these are distinct phonemes forming distinct words in Thai.\nThe long-short pairs are as follows:\n\nThere are also opening and closing diphthongs in Thai, which Tingsabadh & Abramson (1993) analyze as /Vj/ and /Vw/. For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:\n\nAdditionally, there are three triphthongs. For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:\n\nTones\nThere are five phonemic tones: mid, low, falling, high, and rising, sometimes referred to in older reference works as rectus, gravis, circumflexus, altus, and demissus, respectively. The table shows an example of both the phonemic tones and their phonetic realization, in the IPA. Moren & Zsiga (2006) and Zsiga & Nitisaroj (2007) provide phonetic and phonological analyses of Thai tone realization.\n\nNotes:\n\nFive-level tone value: Mid [33], Low [21], Falling [41], High [45], Rising [214]. Traditionally, the high tone was recorded as either [44] or [45]. This remains true for the older generation, but the high tone is changing to [334] among youngsters.\nFor the diachronic changes of tone value, see Pittayaporn (2007).\nThe full complement of tones exists only in so-called \"live syllables\", those that end in a long vowel or a sonorant (/m/, /n/, /\u014b/, /j/, /w/).\nFor \"dead syllables\", those that end in a plosive (/p/, /t/, /k/) or in a short vowel, only three tonal distinctions are possible: low, high, and falling. Because syllables analyzed as ending in a short vowel may have a final glottal stop (especially in slower speech), all \"dead syllables\" are phonetically checked, and have the reduced tonal inventory characteristic of checked syllables.\n\nUnchecked syllables\nChecked syllables\nIn some English loanwords, closed syllables with a long vowel ending in an obstruent sound have a high tone, and closed syllables with a short vowel ending in an obstruent sound have a falling tone.\n\nGrammar\nFrom the perspective of linguistic typology, Thai can be considered to be an analytic language. The word order is subject\u2013verb\u2013object, although the subject is often omitted. Additionally, Thai is an isolating language lacking any form of inflectional morphology whatsoever. Thai pronouns are selected according to the gender and relative status of speaker and audience.\n\nAdjectives and adverbs\nThere is no morphological distinction between adverbs and adjectives. Many words can be used in either function. They follow the word they modify, which may be a noun, verb, or another adjective or adverb.\n\nComparatives take the form \"A X \u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 B\" (kwa, /kw\u00e0\u02d0/), 'A is more X than B'. The superlative is expressed as \"A X \u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\" (thi sut, /t\u02b0\u00ee\u02d0 s\u00f9t/), 'A is most X'.\n\nAdjectives in Thai can be used as complete predicates. Because of this, many words used to indicate tense in verbs (see Verbs:Tense below) may be used to describe adjectives.\n\nRemark \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e34\u0e27\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 mostly means 'I am hungry right now' because normally, \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 (/l\u025b\u0301\u02d0w/) marks the change of a state, but \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 has many other uses as well. For example, in the sentence, \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d\u0e08\u0e30\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e19 (/l\u025b\u0301\u02d0w t\u02b0\u0264\u0304\u02d0 t\u0255\u00e0\u0294 p\u0101j n\u01cej/): 'So where are you going?', \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 (/l\u025b\u0301\u02d0w/) is used as a discourse particle.\n\nVerbs\nVerbs do not inflect. They do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number; nor are there any participles. The language being analytic and case-less, the relationship between subject, direct and indirect object is conveyed through word order and auxiliary verbs. Transitive verbs follow the pattern subject-verb-object.\n\nIn order to convey tense, aspect and mood (TAM), the Thai verbal system employs auxiliaries and verb serialization. TAM markers are however not obligatory and often left out in colloquial use. In such cases, the precise meaning is determined through context. This results in sentences lacking both TAM markers and overt context being ambiguous and subject to various interpretations.\n\nThe sentence chan kin thi nan can thus be interpreted as 'I am eating there', 'I eat there habitually', 'I will eat there' or 'I ate there'.  Aspect markers in Thai have been divided into four distinct groups based on their usage. These markers could appear either before or after the verb. The following list describes some of the most commonly used aspect markers. A number of these aspect markers are also full verbs on their own and carry a distinct meaning. For example yu (\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48) as a full verb means 'to stay, to live or to remain at'. However, as an auxiliary it can be described as a temporary aspect or continuative marker.\n\nImperfective\n\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48 yu /j\u00f9\u02d0/\n\u0e44\u0e1b pai /p\u0101j/\n\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07 yang /j\u0101\u014b/\n\u0e01\u0e33\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07 kamlang /k\u0101m.l\u0101\u014b/\n\u0e40\u0e04\u0e22 khoey /k\u02b0\u0264\u0304\u02d0j/\nPerfective\n\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 dai /d\u00e2\u02d0j/\nPerfect\n\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 laeo /l\u025b\u0301\u02d0w/\n\u0e21\u0e32 ma /m\u0101\u02d0/\nProspective/Future\n\u0e08\u0e30 cha /t\u0255\u00e0\u0294/\nThe imperfective aspect marker \u0e01\u0e33\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07 (kamlang, /k\u0101m l\u0101\u014b/, currently) is used before the verb to denote an ongoing action (similar to the -ing suffix in English). Kamlang is commonly interpreted as a progressive aspect marker. Similarly, \u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48 (yu, /j\u00f9\u02d0/) is a post-verbal aspect marker which corresponds to the continuative or temporary aspect.\n\nComparably \u0e22\u0e31\u0e07 (yang, /j\u0101\u014b/, still) which is used in an incompleted action, and usually cognates in phrase with yu (\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48) or any second marker in common use.\n\nThe marker \u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 (dai, /d\u00e2\u02d0j/) is usually analyzed as a past tense marker when it occurs before the verb. As a full verb, dai means 'to get or receive'. However, when used after a verb, dai takes on a meaning of potentiality or successful outcome of the main verb.\n\n\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 (laeo, /l\u025b\u0301\u02d0w/; 'already') is treated as a marker indicating the perfect aspect. That is to say, laeo marks the event as being completed at the time of reference. Laeo has two other meanings in addition to its use as a TAM marker. Laeo can either be a conjunction for sequential actions or an archaic word for 'to finish'.\n\nFuture can be indicated by \u0e08\u0e30 (cha, /t\u0255\u00e0\u0294/; 'will') before the verb or by a time expression indicating the future. For example:\n\nDative marker \u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49 (hai, /h\u00e2j/; 'give') often used in a sentence as prepositional or double objects.\n\nThe passive voice is indicated by the insertion of \u0e16\u0e39\u0e01 (thuk, /t\u02b0\u00f9\u02d0k/) before the verb. For example:\n\nThis describes an action that is out of the receiver's control and, thus, conveys suffering.\nNegation is indicated by placing \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48 (mai, /m\u00e2j/; not) before the verb.\n\n\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e15\u0e35, (khao mai ti) 'He is not hitting' or 'He doesn't hit'.\nThai exhibits serial verb constructions, where verbs are strung together. Some word combinations are common and may be considered set phrases.\n\nNouns\nNouns are uninflected and have no gender; there are no articles. Thai nouns are bare nouns and can be interpreted as singular, plural, definite or indefinite. Some specific nouns are reduplicated to form collectives: \u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01 (dek, 'child') is often repeated as \u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01 \u0e46 (dek dek) to refer to a group of children. The word \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01 (phuak, /p\u02b0\u00fba\u032fk/) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. (\u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e1c\u0e21, phuak phom, /p\u02b0\u00fba\u032fk p\u02b0\u01d2m/, 'we', masculine; \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 phuak rao, /p\u02b0\u00fba\u032fk r\u0101w/, emphasised 'we'; \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32 phuak ma, '(the) dogs'). Plurals are expressed by adding classifiers, used as measure words (\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e13\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21), in the form of noun-number-classifier:\n\nWhile in English, such classifiers are usually absent (\"four chairs\") or optional (\"two bottles of beer\" or \"two beers\"), a classifier is almost always used in Thai (hence \"chair four item\" and \"beer two bottle\").\nPossession in Thai is indicated by adding the word \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 (khong) in front of the noun or pronoun, but it may often be omitted. For example:\n\nNominal phrases\nNominal phrases in Thai often use a special class of words classifiers. As previously mentioned, these classifiers are obligatory for noun phrases containing numerals e.g.\n\nUnlike any numeral, \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07 ('one') can mark on both positions of classifier, but in different functions. The post-head one potentially marks a referent as indefinite article.\n\nIn the previous example khon (\u0e04\u0e19) acts as the classifier in the nominal phrase. This follows the form of noun-cardinal-classifier mentioned above. Classifiers are also required to form quantified noun phrases in Thai with some quantifiers such as \u0e17\u0e38\u0e01 ('all'), \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07 ('some'). The examples below are demonstrated using the classifier khon, which is used for people.\n\nHowever, classifiers are not utilized for negative quantification. Negative quantification is expressed by the pattern \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35 (mai mi, /m\u00e2j m\u012b\u02d0/) + NOUN.\n\nDemonstratives\nThai has three of its distinctions. Proximal \u0e19\u0e35\u0e48 (ni, /n\u00ee\u02d0/; 'this/these'), medial \u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19 (nan, /n\u00e2n/; 'that/those'), and distal \u0e42\u0e19\u0e48\u0e19 (non, /n\u00f4\u02d0n/; 'that/those over there') which is rarely used.\nIt also has different usage of distinguishing the demonstratives by changing tones. In which the pronoun itself used for \u0e19\u0e35\u0e48 (ni, /n\u00ee\u02d0/); while \u0e19\u0e35\u0e49 (ni, /n\u00ed\u02d0) refers to be modifier placed after the noun, prepositions, classifiers, etc. For example:\n\nFollowing the word \u0e44\u0e2b\u0e19 (nai, /n\u01cej/) which plays role as interrogative determiner or pronoun.\n\nThe syntax for demonstrative phrases, however, differ from that of cardinals and follow the pattern noun-classifier-demonstrative. For example, the noun phrase \"this dog\" would be expressed in Thai as \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49 (literally 'dog (classifier) this').\n\nPronouns\nSubject pronouns are often omitted, with nicknames used where English would use a pronoun. See Thai name#Nicknames for more details. Pronouns, when used, are ranked in honorific registers, and may also make a T\u2013V distinction in relation to kinship and social status. Specialised pronouns are used for royalty, and for Buddhist monks. The following are appropriate for conversational use:\n\nThe reflexive pronoun is \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua eng), which can mean any of: myself, yourself, ourselves, himself, herself, themselves. This can be mixed with another pronoun to create an intensive pronoun, such as \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua phom eng, lit: I myself) or \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua khun eng, lit: you yourself). Thai also does not have a separate possessive pronoun. Instead, possession is indicated by the particle \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 (khong).  For example, \"my mother\" is \u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e21 (mae khong phom, lit: mother of I). This particle is often implicit, so the phrase is shortened to \u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e1c\u0e21 (mae phom). Plural pronouns can be easily constructed by adding the word \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01 (phuak) in front of a singular pronoun as in \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (phuak khao) meaning 'they' or \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (phuak thoe) meaning the plural sense of 'you'. The only exception to this is \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (rao), which can be used as singular (informal) or plural, but can also be used in the form of \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (phuak rao), which is only plural.\nThai has many more pronouns than those listed above. Their usage is full of nuances. For example:\n\n\"\u0e1c\u0e21 \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e14\u0e34\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 \u0e01\u0e39 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1c\u0e21 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e15\u0e21\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e4a\u0e27 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\" all translate to \"I\", but each expresses a different gender, age, politeness, status, or relationship between speaker and listener.\n\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (rao) can be first person (I), second person (you), or both (we), depending on the context.\nChildren or younger female could use or being referred by word \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 (nu) when talking with older person. The word \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 could be both feminine first person (I) and feminine second person (you) and also neuter first and neuter second person for children.\n\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 commonly means rat or mouse, though it also refers to small creatures in general.\nThe second person pronoun \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (thoe) (lit: you) is semi-feminine. It is used only when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. Males usually do not address each other by this pronoun.\nBoth \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 (khun) and \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (thoe) are polite neuter second person pronouns.  However, \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (khun thoe) is a feminine derogative third person.\nInstead of a second person pronoun such as \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 ('you'), it is much more common for unrelated strangers to call each other \u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e25\u0e38\u0e07 \u0e1b\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2d\u0e32 \u0e15\u0e32 or \u0e22\u0e32\u0e22 (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, granny).\nTo express deference, the second person pronoun is sometimes replaced by a profession, similar to how, in English, presiding judges are always addressed as \"your honor\" rather than \"you\".  In Thai, students always address their teachers by \u0e04\u0e23\u0e39, \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39 or \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c (each meaning 'teacher') rather than \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 ('you').  Teachers, monks, and doctors are almost always addressed this way.\n\nParticles\nThe particles are often untranslatable words added to the end of a sentence to indicate respect, a request, encouragement or other moods (similar to the use of intonation in English), as well as varying the level of formality. They are not used in elegant (written) Thai. The most common particles indicating respect are \u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a (khrap, /k\u02b0r\u00e1p/, with a high tone) when the speaker is a man, and \u0e04\u0e48\u0e30 (kha, /k\u02b0\u00e2\u0294/, with a falling tone) when the speaker is a woman. Used in a question or a request, the particle \u0e04\u0e48\u0e30 (falling tone) is changed to a \u0e04\u0e30 (high tone).\nOther common particles are:\n\nRegister\nCentral Thai is composed of several distinct registers, forms for different social contexts:\n\nStreet or Common Thai (\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e39\u0e14, phasa phut, spoken Thai): informal, without polite terms of address, as used between close relatives and friends.\nElegant or Formal Thai (\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19, phasa khian, written Thai): official and written version, includes respectful terms of address; used in simplified form in newspapers.\nRhetorical Thai: used for public speaking.\nReligious Thai: (heavily influenced by Sanskrit and P\u0101li) used when discussing Buddhism or addressing monks.\nRoyal Thai (\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e28\u0e31\u0e1e\u0e17\u0e4c, racha sap): influenced by Khmer, this is used when addressing members of the royal family or describing their activities. (See Monarchy of Thailand \u00a7 Rachasap.)\nMost Thais can speak and understand all of these contexts. Street and Elegant Thai are the basis of all conversations. Rhetorical, religious, and royal Thai are taught in schools as part of the national curriculum.\nAs noted above, Thai has several registers, each having certain usages, such as colloquial, formal, literary, and poetic. Thus, the word 'eat' can be \u0e01\u0e34\u0e19 (kin; common), \u0e41\u0e14\u0e01 (daek; vulgar), \u0e22\u0e31\u0e14 (yat; vulgar), \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e42\u0e20\u0e04 (boriphok; formal), \u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19 (rapprathan; formal), \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 (chan; religious), or \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22 (sawoei; royal), as illustrated below:\n\nThailand also uses the distinctive Thai six-hour clock in addition to the 24-hour clock.\n\nVocabulary\nOther than compound words and words of foreign origin, most words are monosyllabic.\nChinese-language influence was strong until the 13th century when the use of Chinese characters was abandoned, and replaced by Sanskrit and Pali scripts. However, the vocabulary of Thai retains many words borrowed from Middle Chinese.\nKhmer was used as a prestige language in the early days of the Thai kingdoms which are believed to have been bilingual societies proficient in Thai and Khmer. There are over 2,500 Thai words derived from Khmer, surpassing the number of Tai cognates. These Khmer words span across all semantic fields. Thai scholar Uraisi Varasarin classified them into over 200 sub-categories. As a result, it is impossible for Thais, past and present, to engage in a conversation without incorporating Khmer loanwords in any given topic. The influence is particularly preponderant in regard to royal court terminology.\nLater, most vocabulary was borrowed from Sanskrit and P\u0101li; Buddhist terminology is particularly indebted to these. Indic words have a more formal register, and may be compared to Latin and French borrowings in English. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the English language has had the greatest influence, especially for scientific, technical, international, and other modern terms.\n\nArabic-origin\nChinese-origin\nFrom Middle Chinese or Teochew Chinese.\n\nEnglish-origin\nFrench-origin\nJapanese-origin\nKhmer-origin\nFrom Old Khmer\n\nMalay-origin\nPersian-origin\nPortuguese-origin\nThe Portuguese were the first Western nation to arrive in what is modern-day Thailand in the 16th century during the Ayutthaya period. Their influence in trade, especially weaponry, allowed them to establish a community just outside the capital and practise their faith, as well as exposing and converting the locals to Christianity. Thus, Portuguese words involving trade and religion were introduced and used by the locals.\n\nTamil-origin\nWriting system\nThai is written in the Thai script, an abugida written from left to right. The language and its script are closely related to the Lao language and script. Most literate Lao are able to read and understand Thai, as more than half of the Thai vocabulary, grammar, intonation, vowels and so forth are common with the Lao language.\nThe Thais adopted and modified the Khmer script to create their own writing system. While in Thai the pronunciation can largely be inferred from the script, the orthography is complex, with silent letters to preserve original spellings and many letters representing the same sound. While the oldest known inscription in the Khmer language dates from 611 CE, inscriptions in Thai writing began to appear around 1292 CE. Notable features include:\n\nIt is an abugida script, in which the implicit vowel is a short /a/ in a syllable without final consonant and a short /o/ in a syllable with final consonant.\nTone markers, if present, are placed above the final onset consonant of the syllable.\nVowels sounding after an initial consonant can be located before, after, above or below the consonant, or in a combination of these positions.\n\nTranscription\nThere is no universally applied method for transcribing Thai into the Latin alphabet. For example, the name of the main airport is transcribed variably as Suvarnabhumi, Suwannaphum, or Suwunnapoom. Guide books, textbooks and dictionaries follow different systems. For this reason, many language courses recommend that learners master the Thai script.\nOfficial standards are the Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS), published by the Royal Institute of Thailand, and the almost identical ISO 11940-2 defined by the International Organization for Standardization. The RTGS system is increasingly used in Thailand by central and local governments, especially for road signs. Its main drawback is that it does not indicate tone or vowel length. As the system is based on pronunciation, not orthography, reconstruction of Thai spelling from RTGS romanisation is not possible.\n\nTransliteration\nThe ISO published an international standard for the transliteration of Thai into Roman script in September 2005 (ISO 11940). By adding diacritics to the Latin letters it makes the transcription reversible, making it a true transliteration. Notably, this system is used by Google Translate, although it does not seem to appear in many other contexts, such as textbooks and other instructional media.\n\nSee also\nThai script\nThai honorifics\nThai literature\nThai numerals\nThai braille\nThai typography\nComparison of Lao and Thai\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nCitations\nGeneral and cited sources\nFurther reading\nInglis, Douglas. 1999.

Here is a detailed extraction of the most useful parts of the Wikipedia article for this purpose:\n\n### Phonology\n\n#### Consonants\n- **Initials**: Thai distinguishes three voice-onset times among plosive and affricate consonants: voiced, tenuis (unvoiced, unaspirated), and aspirated. The article provides a table with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols and corresponding Thai characters for initial consonants.\n- **Finals**: Only eight sounds are used as finals, with specific consonants devoiced at the end of syllables. The article lists the consonants and their final sounds.\n- **Clusters**: Thai allows specific consonant clusters, primarily in initial positions, with combinations like /kr/, /kl/, /kw/, etc.\n\n#### Vowels\n- Thai has nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each occurring in short or long forms. The article provides a table with IPA symbols and Thai script representations.\n- **Diphthongs and Triphthongs**: The article lists opening and closing diphthongs and triphthongs, noting which are sometimes classified as long for tonal purposes.\n\n#### Tones\n- Thai has five phonemic tones: mid, low, falling, high, and rising. The article provides examples and phonetic realizations in IPA, along with notes on tone values and distinctions between \"live\" and \"dead\" syllables.\n\n### Grammar\n\n#### Word Order and Structure\n- Thai is an analytic language with a subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order. It lacks inflectional morphology, meaning verbs do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number.\n\n#### Adjectives and Adverbs\n- No morphological distinction exists between adjectives and adverbs. They follow the word they modify. Comparatives and superlatives are formed using specific structures.\n\n#### Verbs\n- Verbs do not inflect. Tense, aspect, and mood are conveyed through auxiliary verbs and context. The article lists common aspect markers and their uses, such as \u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48 (yu) for continuative aspect and \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 (laeo) for perfect aspect.\n\n#### Nouns\n- Nouns are uninflected, with no gender or articles. Plurals are formed using classifiers, and possession is indicated by \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 (khong).\n\n#### Nominal Phrases\n- Classifiers are essential in quantified noun phrases, with specific patterns for numerals and quantifiers.\n\n#### Demonstratives\n- Thai has proximal, medial, and distal demonstratives, with specific syntax for demonstrative phrases.\n\n#### Pronouns\n- Pronouns vary based on gender, status, and context. The article lists common pronouns and their nuances, including reflexive and possessive forms.\n\n#### Particles\n- Particles are used to indicate respect, requests, and other moods.

It belongs to the Vietic subgroup of the Austroasiatic language family. Vietnamese is spoken natively by around 85 million people, several times as many as the rest of the Austroasiatic family combined. It is the native language of ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh), as well as the second or first language for other ethnicities of Vietnam, and used by Vietnamese diaspora in the world. \nLike many languages in Southeast Asia and East Asia, Vietnamese is highly analytic and is tonal. It has head-initial directionality, with subject\u2013verb\u2013object order and modifiers following the words they modify. It also uses noun classifiers. Its vocabulary has had significant influence from Middle Chinese and French. Although most of its phonological words are monosyllabic, Vietnamese has systems of compounding and reduplication which leads to the majority of Vietnamese vocabulary being disyllabic and trisyllabic words.\nVietnamese is written using the Vietnamese alphabet (ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef). The alphabet is based on the Latin script and was officially adopted in the early 20th century during French rule of Vietnam. It uses digraphs and diacritics to mark tones and some phonemes. Vietnamese was historically written using ch\u1eef N\u00f4m, a logographic script using Chinese characters (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n) to represent Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary and some native Vietnamese words, together with many locally invented characters representing other words.\n\nClassification\nEarly linguistic work in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Logan 1852, Forbes 1881, M\u00fcller 1888, Kuhn 1889, Schmidt 1905, Przyluski 1924, and Benedict 1942) classified Vietnamese as belonging to the Mon\u2013Khmer branch of the Austroasiatic language family (which also includes the Khmer language spoken in Cambodia, as well as various smaller and/or regional languages, such as the Munda and Khasi languages spoken in eastern India, and others in Laos, southern China and parts of Thailand). In 1850, British lawyer James Richardson Logan detected striking similarities between the Korku language in Central India and Vietnamese. He suggested that Korku, Mon, and Vietnamese were part of what he termed \"Mon\u2013Annam languages\" in a paper published in 1856. Later, in 1920, French-Polish linguist Jean Przyluski found that M\u01b0\u1eddng is more closely related to Vietnamese than other Mon\u2013Khmer languages, and a Viet\u2013Muong subgrouping was established, also including Thavung, Chut, Cuoi, etc. The term \"Vietic\" was proposed by Hayes (1992), who proposed to redefine Viet\u2013Muong as referring to a subbranch of Vietic containing only Vietnamese and M\u01b0\u1eddng. The term \"Vietic\" is used, among others, by G\u00e9rard Diffloth, with a slightly different proposal on subclassification, within which the term \"Viet\u2013Muong\" refers to a lower subgrouping (within an eastern Vietic branch) consisting of Vietnamese dialects, M\u01b0\u1eddng dialects, and Ngu\u1ed3n (of Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province).\n\nHistory\nAustroasiatic is believed to have dispersed around 2000 BC.\nThe arrival of the agricultural Ph\u00f9ng Nguy\u00ean culture in the Red River Delta at that time may correspond to the Vietic branch.\nThis ancestral Vietic was typologically very different from later Vietnamese.\nAs well as monosyllabic roots, it had sesquisyllabic roots consisting of a reduced syllable followed by a full syllable, and featured many consonant clusters.\nBoth of these features are found elsewhere in Austroasiatic and in modern conservative Vietic languages south of the Red River area.\nThe language was non-tonal, but featured glottal stop and voiceless fricative codas.\nBorrowed vocabulary indicates early contact with speakers of Tai languages in the last millennium BC, which is consistent with genetic evidence from Dong Son culture sites.\nExtensive contact with Chinese began from the Han dynasty (2nd century BC).\nAt this time, Vietic groups began to expand south from the Red River Delta and into the adjacent uplands, possibly to escape Chinese encroachment.\nThe oldest layer of loans from Chinese into northern Vietic (which would become the Viet\u2013Muong subbranch) date from this period.\nThe northern Vietic varieties thus became part of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, in which languages from genetically unrelated families converged toward characteristics such as isolating morphology and similar syllable structure. Many languages in this area, including Viet\u2013Muong, underwent a process of tonogenesis, in which distinctions formerly expressed by final consonants became phonemic tonal distinctions when those consonants disappeared. These characteristics have become part of many of the genetically unrelated languages of Southeast Asia; for example, Tsat (a member of the Malayo-Polynesian group within Austronesian), and Vietnamese each developed tones as a phonemic feature.\n\nAfter the split from Muong around the end of the first millennium AD, the following stages of Vietnamese are commonly identified:\n\nAncient (or Old) Vietnamese\n(to c.\u20091500) Sources include the Ming glossary \u0100nn\u00e1ngu\u00f3 y\u00ecy\u01d4 (\u5b89\u5357\u570b\u8b6f\u8a9e, c. 15th century) from the Huayi yiyu series, and a Buddhist sutra recorded in an early form of chu Nom, variously dated to the 12th and 15th centuries. Compared with Proto-Vietic, the language had lost the voicing distinction on stop initials, giving rise to a tone split, and implosive initials had become nasals. Most of the minor syllables of Proto-Vietic were still present.\nMiddle Vietnamese\n(16th to 19th centuries) The language found in Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum (1651) of the Jesuit missionary Alexandre de Rhodes. Another famous dictionary of this period was written by Pierre Pigneau de Behaine in 1773 and published by Jean-Louis Taberd in 1838.\nModern Vietnamese\n(from the 19th century)\nAfter expelling the Chinese at the beginning of the 10th century, the Ng\u00f4 dynasty adopted Classical Chinese as the formal medium of government, scholarship and literature. With the dominance of Chinese came wholesale importation of Chinese vocabulary. The resulting Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary makes up about a third of the Vietnamese lexicon in all realms, and may account for as much as 60% of the vocabulary used in formal texts.\nVietic languages were confined to the northern third of modern Vietnam until the \"southward advance\" (Nam ti\u1ebfn) from the late 15th century.\nThe conquest of the ancient nation of Champa and the conquest of the Mekong Delta led to an expansion of the Vietnamese people and language, with distinctive local variations emerging.\nAfter France invaded Vietnam in the late 19th century, French gradually replaced Literary Chinese as the official language in education and government. Vietnamese adopted many French terms, such as \u0111\u1ea7m ('dame', from madame), ga ('train station', from gare), s\u01a1 mi ('shirt', from chemise), and b\u00fap b\u00ea ('doll', from poup\u00e9e), resulting in a language that was Austroasiatic but with major Sino-influences and some minor French influences from the French colonial era.\n\nProto-Vietic\nThe following diagram shows the consonants of Proto-Vietic, along with the outcomes in the modern language:\n\nThe aspirated stops are infrequent and result from clusters of stops and */h/.\nThe proto-phoneme */t\u0283/ is also infrequent, and has reflexes only in Viet-Muong. However, it occurs in some important words and is cognate with Khmu /c/.\nFerlus 1992 also had additional phonemes */d\u0292/ and */\u0255/.\nProto-Vietic had monosyllables CV(C) and sesquisyllables C-CV(C).\nThe following initial clusters occurred, with outcomes indicated:\n\n*pr, *br, *tr, *dr, *kr, *gr > /k\u02b0r/ > /k\u0282/ > s\n*pl, *bl > MV bl > Northern gi, Southern tr\n*kl, *gl > MV tl > tr\n*ml > MV ml > mnh > nh\n*kj > gi\n\nLenition of medial consonants\nAs noted above, Proto-Vietic had sesquisyllabic words with an initial minor syllable (in addition to, and independent of, initial clusters in the main syllable). When a minor syllable occurred, the main syllable's initial consonant was intervocalic and as a result suffered lenition, becoming a voiced fricative. These fricatives were not present in Proto-Viet\u2013Muong, as indicated by their absence in M\u01b0\u1eddng, but were present in Vietnamese until the 15th or 16th centuries. Subsequent loss of the minor-syllable prefixes phonemicized the fricatives. Ferlus 1992 proposes that originally there were both voiced and voiceless fricatives, corresponding to original voiced or voiceless stops, but Ferlus 2009 appears to have abandoned that hypothesis, suggesting that stops were softened and voiced at approximately the same time, according to the following pattern:\n\n*p, *b > /\u03b2/ > v. In Middle Vietnamese, the outcome of these sounds was written with a hooked b (\ua797), representing a /\u03b2/ that was still distinct from v (then pronounced /w/).\n*t, *d > /\u00f0/ > d\n*c, *\u025f, *t\u0283 > /\u029d/ > gi\n*k, *\u0261 > /\u0263/ > g/gh\n*s > /r\u031d/ > r\n\nOrigin of tones\nProto-Vietic did not have tones. Tones developed later in some of the daughter languages from distinctions in the initial and final consonants. Vietnamese tones developed as follows:\n\nGlottal-ending syllables ended with a glottal stop /\u0294/, while fricative-ending syllables ended with /s/ or /h/. Both types of syllables could co-occur with a resonant (e.g. /m/ or /n/).\nAt some point, a tone split occurred, as in many other mainland Southeast Asian languages. Essentially, an allophonic distinction developed in the tones, whereby the tones in syllables with voiced initials were pronounced differently from those with voiceless initials. (Approximately speaking, the voiced allotones were pronounced with additional breathy voice or creaky voice and with lowered pitch. The quality difference predominates in today's northern varieties, e.g. in Hanoi, while in the southern varieties the pitch difference predominates, as in Ho Chi Minh City.) Subsequent to this, the plain-voiced stops became voiceless and the allotones became new phonemic tones.\nThe implosive stops (\u0253, \u0257 and \u0284) were unaffected, and in fact developed tonally as if they were unvoiced. (This behavior is common to all East Asian languages with implosive stops.)\nThese stops merged with the corresponding nasals (m, n and \u0272) before the Old Vietnamese period.\nAs noted above, consonants following minor syllables became voiced fricatives. The minor syllables were eventually lost, but not until the tone split had occurred. As a result, words in modern Vietnamese with voiced fricatives occur in all six tones, and the tonal register reflects the voicing of the minor-syllable prefix and not the voicing of the main-syllable stop in Proto-Vietic that produced the fricative. For similar reasons, words beginning with /l/ and /\u014b/ occur in both registers. (Thompson 1976 reconstructed voiceless resonants to account for outcomes where resonants occur with a first-register tone, but this is no longer considered necessary, at least by Ferlus.)\nA large number of words were borrowed from Middle Chinese, forming part of the Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. These caused the original introduction of the retroflex sounds /\u0282/ and /\u0288/ (modern s, tr) into the language.\n\nOld Vietnamese\nOld (or Ancient) Vietnamese separated from Muong around the 9th century. The sources for the reconstruction of Old Vietnamese are Nom texts, such as the 12th-century/1486 Buddhist scripture Ph\u1eadt thuy\u1ebft \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e1o ph\u1ee5 m\u1eabu \u00e2n tr\u1ecdng kinh (\"S\u016btra explained by the Buddha on the Great Repayment of the Heavy Debt to Parents\"), old inscriptions, and a late 13th-century (possibly 1293) Annan Jishi glossary by Chinese diplomat Chen Fu (c. 1259 \u2013 1309).\n\nThe \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e1o used Chinese characters phonetically where each word, monosyllabic in Modern Vietnamese, is written with two Chinese characters or in a composite character made of two different characters. This conveys the transformation of the Vietnamese lexicon from sesquisyllabic to fully monosyllabic under the pressure of Chinese linguistic influence, characterized by linguistic phenomena such as the reduction of minor syllables; loss of affixal morphology drifting towards analytical grammar; simplification of major syllable segments, and the change of suprasegment instruments. For example, the modern Vietnamese word tr\u1eddi 'heaven' was *pl\u1eddi in Old Vietnamese and bl\u1eddi in Middle Vietnamese.\nSubsequent changes to initial consonants included:\n\nre-introduction of implosive stops p > \u0253 and t > \u0257\ns > ts > t\nt\u0283 > \u0255\na merger j > \u00f0\n\nMiddle Vietnamese\nThe writing system used for Vietnamese is based closely on the system developed by Alexandre de Rhodes for his 1651 Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum. It reflects the pronunciation of the Vietnamese of Hanoi at that time, a stage commonly termed Middle Vietnamese (ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t trung \u0111\u1ea1i). The pronunciation of the \"rime\" of the syllable, i.e. all parts other than the initial consonant (optional /w/ glide, vowel nucleus, tone and final consonant), appears nearly identical between Middle Vietnamese and modern Hanoi pronunciation. On the other hand, the Middle Vietnamese pronunciation of the initial consonant differs greatly from all modern dialects, and in fact is significantly closer to the modern Saigon dialect than the modern Hanoi dialect.\n\nThe following diagram shows the orthography and pronunciation of Middle Vietnamese:\n\n^1  [p] occurs only at the end of a syllable.\n^2  This letter, \u27e8\ua797\u27e9, is no longer used.\n^3  [j] does not occur at the beginning of a syllable, but can occur at the end of a syllable, where it is notated i or y (with the difference between the two often indicating differences in the quality or length of the preceding vowel), and after /\u00f0/ and /\u03b2/, where it is notated \u0115. This \u0115, and the /j/ it notated, have disappeared from the modern language.\nNote that b [\u0253] and p [p] never contrast in any position, suggesting that they are allophones.\nThe language also has three clusters at the beginning of syllables, which have since disappeared:\n\ntl /tl/ > modern tr - tl\u01b0\u1edbc > tr\u01b0\u1edbc (written in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m as \ud86c\udffe (\u2ff0\u8eca\u7567) where \u8eca represented the initial tl- sound).\nbl /\u0253l/ > modern gi (Northern), tr (Southern) - bl\u0103ng > tr\u0103ng/gi\u0103ng (written in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m as \ud86a\ude6e (\u2ff1\u5df4\u590c) where \u5df4 represented the initial bl- sound).\nml /ml/ > mnh /m\u0272/ > modern nh (Northern), l (Southern) - ml\u1eddi > l\u1eddi/nh\u1eddi (written in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m as \ud840\udd5c (\u2ff1\u4ea0\u4f8b) where \u4ea0 (simplified from \u9ebb) represented the initial ml- sound).\n\nMost of the unusual correspondences between spelling and modern pronunciation are explained by Middle Vietnamese. Note in particular:\n\nde Rhodes' system has two different b letters, \u27e8b\u27e9 and \u27e8\ua797\u27e9. The latter apparently represented a voiced bilabial fricative /\u03b2/. Within a century or so, both /\u03b2/ and /w/ had merged as /v/, spelled as v.\nde Rhodes' system has a second medial glide /j/ that is written \u0115 and appears in some words with initial d and hooked b. These later disappear.\n\u0111 /\u0257/ was (and still is) alveolar, whereas d /\u00f0/ was dental. The choice of symbols was based on the dental rather than alveolar nature of /d/ and its allophone [\u00f0] in Spanish and other Romance languages. The inconsistency with the symbols assigned to /\u0253/ vs. /\u03b2/ was based on the lack of any such place distinction between the two, with the result that the stop consonant /\u0253/ appeared more \"normal\" than the fricative /\u03b2/. In both cases, the implosive nature of the stops does not appear to have had any role in the choice of symbol.\nx was the alveolo-palatal fricative /\u0255/ rather than the dental /s/ of the modern language. In 17th-century Portuguese, the common language of the Jesuits, s was the apico-alveolar sibilant /s\u033a/ (as still in much of Spain and some parts of Portugal), while x was a palatoalveolar /\u0283/. The similarity of apicoalveolar /s\u033a/ to the Vietnamese retroflex /\u0282/ led to the assignment of s and x as above.\nDe Rhodes's orthography also made use of an apex diacritic on o\u1dc3 and u\u1dc3 to indicate a final labial-velar nasal /\u014b\u0361m/, an allophone of /\u014b/ that is peculiar to the Hanoi dialect to the present day. An example is xao\u1dc3 /\u0255aw\u014b\u0361mA1/, which later became xong. This diacritic is often mistaken for a tilde in modern reproductions of early Vietnamese writing.\n\nPost Vietnam War\nFollowing the defeat of Southern Vietnam in 1975 by Northern Vietnam in the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese language within Vietnam has gradually shifted towards the Northern dialect. Hanoi, the largest city in Northern Vietnam was made the capital of Vietnam in 1976. A study stated that \"The gap in vocabulary use between speakers in North and South Vietnam is now much narrower than before. There is little to distinguish between how the generations that were born and grew up in the South after 1975 now speak, compared to their peers in the North. This gap is almost non-existent in newspapers, on radio and television, and in websites.\" However, this convergence does not apply to immigrants, in which the study states represent \"culture freeze,\" a phenomenon that describes when culture among immigrants is frozen in time and does not evolve with culture in their home country once they move to a new country. Here, culture freeze describes that the use of the language of immigrants from Vietnam has been \"frozen\" in both vocabulary and pronunciation, and as languages gradually evolve over time, has become a little different than the present Vietnamese language in Vietnam. Additionally, as immigration to the United States following the Vietnam war was primarily driven due to political reasons, the Southern Vietnamese dialect was initially strongly linked to social identity. During and after the Vietnam War, thousands of Southern Vietnamese immigrated to the United States with the partnership between Saigon and the US. In contrast, during and following the Vietnam War, thousands of Northern Vietnamese moved to the Czech Republic due to Hanoi's partnership with the now obsolete Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. As a result, today, the Vietnamese language is generally taught through the Northern dialect in the Czech Republic in contrast with the Southern dialect in the United States.\n\nGeographic distribution\nAs a result of emigration, Vietnamese speakers are also found in other parts of Southeast Asia, East Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia. Vietnamese has also been officially recognized as a minority language in the Czech Republic.\nAs the national language, Vietnamese is the lingua franca in Vietnam. It is also spoken by the Jing people traditionally residing on three islands (now joined to the mainland) off Dongxing in southern Guangxi Province, China. A large number of Vietnamese speakers also reside in neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos.\nIn the United States, Vietnamese is the sixth most spoken language, with over 1.5 million speakers, who are concentrated in a handful of states. It is the third-most spoken language in Texas and Washington; fourth-most in Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia; and fifth-most in Arkansas and California. Vietnamese is the third most spoken language in Australia other than English, after Mandarin and Arabic. In France, it is the most spoken Asian language and the eighth most spoken immigrant language at home.\n\nOfficial status\nVietnamese is the sole official and national language of Vietnam. It is the first language of the majority of the Vietnamese population, as well as a first or second language for the country's ethnic minority groups.\nIn the Czech Republic, Vietnamese has been recognized as one of 14 minority languages, on the basis of communities that have resided in the country either traditionally or on a long-term basis. This status grants the Vietnamese community in the country a representative on the Government Council for Nationalities, an advisory body of the Czech Government for matters of policy towards national minorities and their members. It also grants the community the right to use Vietnamese with public authorities and in courts anywhere in the country.\n\nAs a foreign language\nVietnamese is taught in schools and institutions outside of Vietnam, a large part contributed by its diaspora. In countries with Vietnamese-speaking communities Vietnamese language education largely serves as a role to link descendants of Vietnamese immigrants to their ancestral culture. In neighboring countries and vicinities near Vietnam such as Southern China, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, Vietnamese as a foreign language is largely due to trade, as well as recovery and growth of the Vietnamese economy.\nSince the 1980s, Vietnamese language schools (tr\u01b0\u1eddng Vi\u1ec7t ng\u1eef/ tr\u01b0\u1eddng ng\u00f4n ng\u1eef Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t) have been established for youth in many Vietnamese-speaking communities around the world such as in the United States, Germany and France.\n\nPhonology\nVowels\nVietnamese has a large number of vowels. Below is a vowel diagram of Vietnamese from Hanoi (including centering diphthongs):\n\nFront and central vowels (i, \u00ea, e, \u01b0, \u00e2, \u01a1, \u0103, a) are unrounded, whereas the back vowels (u, \u00f4, o) are rounded. The vowels \u00e2 [\u0259] and \u0103 [a] are pronounced very short, much shorter than the other vowels. Thus, \u01a1 and \u00e2 are basically pronounced the same except that \u01a1 [\u0259\u02d0] is of normal length while \u00e2 [\u0259] is short \u2013 the same applies to the vowels long a [a\u02d0] and short \u0103 [a].\nThe centering diphthongs are formed with only the three high vowels (i, \u01b0, u). They are generally spelled as ia, \u01b0a, ua when they end a word and are spelled i\u00ea, \u01b0\u01a1, u\u00f4, respectively, when they are followed by a consonant.\nIn addition to single vowels (or monophthongs) and centering diphthongs, Vietnamese has closing diphthongs and triphthongs. The closing diphthongs and triphthongs consist of a main vowel component followed by a shorter semivowel offglide /j/ or /w/. There are restrictions on the high offglides: /j/ cannot occur after a front vowel (i, \u00ea, e) nucleus and /w/ cannot occur after a back vowel (u, \u00f4, o) nucleus.\n\nThe correspondence between the orthography and pronunciation is complicated. For example, the offglide /j/ is usually written as i; however, it may also be represented with y. In addition, in the diphthongs [\u0101j] and [\u0101\u02d0j] the letters y and i also indicate the pronunciation of the main vowel: ay = \u0103 + /j/, ai = a + /j/. Thus, tay \"hand\" is [t\u0101j] while tai \"ear\" is [t\u0101\u02d0j]. Similarly, u and o indicate different pronunciations of the main vowel: au = \u0103 + /w/, ao = a + /w/. Thus, thau \"brass\" is [t\u02b0\u0101w] while thao \"raw silk\" is [t\u02b0\u0101\u02d0w].\n\nConsonants\nThe consonants that occur in Vietnamese are listed below in the Vietnamese orthography with the phonetic pronunciation to the right.\n\nSome consonant sounds are written with only one letter (like \"p\"), other consonant sounds are written with a digraph (like \"ph\"), and others are written with more than one letter or digraph (the velar stop is written variously as \"c\", \"k\", or \"q\"). In some cases, they are based on their Middle Vietnamese pronunciation; since that period, ph and kh (but not th) have evolved from aspirated stops into fricatives (like Greek phi and chi), while d and gi have collapsed and converged together (into /z/ in the north and /j/ in the south).\nNot all dialects of Vietnamese have the same consonant in a given word (although all dialects use the same spelling in the written language). See the language variation section for further elaboration.\nSyllable-final orthographic ch and nh in Vietnamese has had different analyses. One analysis has final ch, nh as being phonemes /c/, /\u0272/ contrasting with syllable-final t, c /t/, /k/ and n, ng /n/, /\u014b/ and identifies final ch with the syllable-initial ch /c/. The other analysis has final ch and nh as predictable allophonic variants of the velar phonemes /k/ and /\u014b/ that occur after the upper front vowels i /i/ and \u00ea /e/; although they also occur after a, but in such cases are believed to have resulted from an earlier e /\u025b/ which diphthongized to ai (cf. ach from aic, anh from aing). (See Vietnamese phonology: Analysis of final ch, nh for further details.)\n\nTones\nEach Vietnamese syllable is pronounced with one of six inherent tones, centered on the main vowel or group of vowels. Tones differ in:\n\nlength (duration)\npitch contour (i.e. pitch melody)\npitch height\nphonation\nTone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel (most of the tone diacritics appear above the vowel; except the n\u1eb7ng tone dot diacritic goes below the vowel). The six tones in the northern varieties (including Hanoi), with their self-referential Vietnamese names, are:\n\nOther dialects of Vietnamese may have fewer tones (typically only five).\n\nIn Vietnamese poetry, tones are classed into two groups: (tone pattern)\n\nWords with tones belonging to a particular tone group must occur in certain positions within the poetic verse.\nVietnamese Catholics practice a distinctive style of prayer recitation called \u0111\u1ecdc kinh, in which each tone is assigned a specific note or sequence of notes.\n\nOld tonal classification\nBefore Vietnamese switched from a Chinese-based script to a Latin-based script, Vietnamese had used the traditional Chinese system of classifying tones. Using this system, Vietnamese has 8 tones, but modern linguists only count 6 phonemic tones.\nVietnamese tones were classified into two main groups, b\u1eb1ng (\u5e73; 'level tones') and tr\u1eafc (\u4ec4; 'sharp tones'). Tones such as ngang belong to the b\u1eb1ng group, while other tones such as ng\u00e3 belong to the tr\u1eafc group. Then, these tones were further divided in several other categorizes: b\u00ecnh (\u5e73; 'even'), th\u01b0\u1ee3ng (\u4e0a; 'rising'), kh\u1ee9 (\u53bb; 'departing'), and nh\u1eadp (\u5165; 'entering').\nS\u1eafc and n\u1eb7ng are counted twice in the system, once in kh\u1ee9 (\u53bb; 'departing') and again in nh\u1eadp (\u5165; 'entering'). The reason for the extra two tones is that syllables ending in the stops /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/ are treated as having entering tones, but phonetically they are exactly the same.\nThe tones in the old classification were called \u00c2m b\u00ecnh \u9670\u5e73 (ngang), D\u01b0\u01a1ng b\u00ecnh \u967d\u5e73 (huy\u1ec1n), \u00c2m th\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u9670\u4e0a (h\u1ecfi), D\u01b0\u01a1ng th\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u967d\u4e0a (ng\u00e3), \u00c2m kh\u1ee9 \u9670\u53bb (s\u1eafc; for words that do not end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/), D\u01b0\u01a1ng kh\u1ee9 \u967d\u53bb (n\u1eb7ng; for words that do not end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/), \u00c2m nh\u1eadp \u9670\u5165 (s\u1eafc; for words that do end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/), and D\u01b0\u01a1ng nh\u1eadp \u967d\u5165 (n\u1eb7ng; for words that do end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/).\n\nGrammar\nVietnamese, like Thai and many languages in Southeast Asia, is an analytic language. Vietnamese does not use morphological marking of case, gender, number or tense (and, as a result, has no finite/nonfinite distinction). Also like other languages in the region, Vietnamese syntax conforms to subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order, is head-initial (displaying modified-modifier ordering), and has a noun classifier system. Additionally, it is pro-drop, wh-in-situ, and allows verb serialization.\nSome Vietnamese sentences with English word glosses and translations are provided below.\n\nLexicon\nAustroasiatic origins\nMany early studies hypothesized Vietnamese language-origins to have been either Kra-Dai, Sino-Tibetan, or Austroasiatic. Austroasiatic origins are so far the most tenable to date, with some of the oldest words in Vietnamese being Austroasiatic in origin.\n\nChinese contact\nAlthough Vietnamese roots are classified as Austroasiatic, Vietic, and Viet-Muong, language contact with Chinese heavily influenced the Vietnamese language, causing it to diverge from Viet-Muong around the 10th to 11th century and become the Vietnamese we know today. For instance, the Vietnamese word qu\u1ea3n l\u00fd, meaning \"management\" (noun) or \"manage\" (verb), likely descended from the same word as gu\u01cenl\u01d0 (\u7ba1\u7406) in Chinese (also kanri (\u7ba1\u7406, \u304b\u3093\u308a) in Japanese and gwalli (gwan+ri; Korean: \uad00\ub9ac; Hanja: \u7ba1\u7406) in Korean). Instances of Chinese contact include the historical Nam Vi\u1ec7t (aka Nanyue) as well as other periods of influence. Besides English and French, which have made some contributions to the Vietnamese language, Japanese loanwords into Vietnamese are also a more recently studied phenomenon.\nModern linguists describe modern Vietnamese having lost many Proto-Austroasiatic phonological and morphological features that original Vietnamese had. The Chinese influence on Vietnamese corresponds to various periods when Vietnam was under Chinese rule and subsequent influence after Vietnam became independent. Early linguists thought that this meant the Vietnamese lexicon had only two influxes of Chinese words, one stemming from the period under actual Chinese rule and a second from afterwards. These words are grouped together as Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary.\nHowever, according to linguist John Phan, \u201cAnnamese Middle Chinese\u201d was already used and spoken in the Red River Valley by the 1st century CE, and its vocabulary significantly fused with the co-existing Proto-Viet-Muong language, the immediate ancestor of Vietnamese. He lists three major classes of Sino-Vietnamese borrowings: Early Sino-Vietnamese (Han dynasty ca. 1st century CE and Jin dynasty ca. 4th century CE), Late Sino-Vietnamese (Tang dynasty), and Recent Sino-Vietnamese (Ming dynasty and afterwards)\n\nFrench era\nVietnam became a French protectorate/colonial territory in 1883 (until the Geneva Accords of 1954), which resulted in significant influence from French into the Indochina region (Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam). Examples include:\n\"C\u00e0 ph\u00ea\" in Vietnamese was derived from the French caf\u00e9 (coffee). Yogurt in Vietnamese is \"s\u1eefa chua\" (lit. \"sour milk\"), but it is also calqued from French (yaourt) into Vietnamese (da ua - /j/a ua). \"Ph\u00f4 mai\" (cheese) is from the French fromage. Musical note was borrowed into Vietnamese as \"n\u1ed1t\" or \"n\u1ed1t nh\u1ea1c\", from the French note de musique. The Vietnamese term for steering wheel is \"v\u00f4 l\u0103ng\", a partial derivation from the French volant directionnel. A necktie (cravate in French) is rendered into Vietnamese as \"c\u00e0 v\u1ea1t\".\nIn addition, modern Vietnamese pronunciations of French names correspond directly to the original French pronunciations (\"Pa-ri\" for Paris, \"M\u00e1c-x\u00e2y\" for Marseille, \"Bo\u00f3c-\u0111\u00f4\" for Bordeaux, etc.), whereas pronunciations of other foreign names (Chinese excluded) are generally derived from English.\n\nEnglish\nSome English words were incorporated into Vietnamese as loan words - such as \"TV\", borrowed as \"tivi\" or just TV, but still officially called truy\u1ec1n h\u00ecnh. Some other borrowings are calques, translated into Vietnamese. For example, 'software' is translated into \"ph\u1ea7n m\u1ec1m\" (literally meaning \"soft part\"). Some scientific terms, such as \"biological cell\", were derived from ch\u1eef H\u00e1n. For example, the word t\u1ebf b\u00e0o is \u7d30\u80de in ch\u1eef H\u00e1n, whilst other scientific names such as \"acetylcholine\" are unaltered. Words like \"peptide\" may be seen as peptit.\n\nJapanese\nJapanese loanwords are a more recently studied phenomenon, with a paper by Nguy\u1ec5n & L\u00ea (2020) classifying three waves of Japanese influence - with the first two waves being the principal influxes and the third wave coming from the Vietnamese who studied Japanese. The first wave consisted of Kanji words created by Japanese to represent Western concepts that were not readily available in Chinese or Japanese, where by the end of the 19th century they were imported to other Asian languages. This first influx is called Sino-Vietnamese words of Japanese origins. For example, the Vietnamese term for \"association club\", c\u00e2u l\u1ea1c b\u1ed9, which was borrowed from Chinese (\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8, pinyin: j\u00f9l\u00e8b\u00f9, jyutping: keoi1 lok6 bou6), and then in turn from Japanese (kanji: \u5036\u697d\u90e8, katakana: \u30af\u30e9\u30d6, r\u014dmaji: kurabu) which came from the English \"club\", resulting in indirect borrowing from Japanese.\nThe second wave was during the brief Japanese occupation of Vietnam from 1940 until 1945. However, Japanese cultural influence in Vietnam started significantly from the 1980s. This newer second wave of Japanese-origin loanwords is distinctive from the Sino-Vietnamese words of Japanese origin in that they were borrowed directly from Japanese. This vocabulary includes words representative of Japanese culture, such as kimono, sumo, samurai, and bonsai from modified Hepburn romanisation. These loanwords are coined as \"new Japanese loanwords\". A significant number of new Japanese loanwords were also of Chinese origin. Sometimes the same concept can be described using both Sino-Vietnamese words of Japanese origin (first wave) and new Japanese loanwords (second wave). For example, judo can be referred to as both judo and nhu \u0111\u1ea1o, the Vietnamese reading of \u67d4\u9053.\n\nModern Chinese influence\nSome words, such as l\u1ea1p x\u01b0\u1edfng from \u81d8\u8178 (Chinese sausage), primarily keep to the Cantonese pronunciations, having been brought over by southern Chinese migrants, whereas in H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t, which has been described as being close to Middle Chinese pronunciation, it is actually pronounced l\u1ea1p tr\u01b0\u1eddng. However, the Cantonese term is the better-known name for Chinese sausage in Vietnam. Meanwhile, any new terms calqued from Chinese would be based on the Mandarin pronunciation. Additionally, in the southern provinces of Vietnam, the term x\u00ed ng\u1ea7u can be used to refer to dice, which may have derived from a Cantonese or Teochew idiom, \"x\u1eadp x\u00ed, x\u1eadp ng\u1ea7u\" (\u5341\u56db, \u5341\u4e94, Sino-Vietnamese: th\u1eadp t\u1ee9, th\u1eadp ng\u0169), literally \"fourteen, fifteen\" to mean 'uncertain'.\n\nPure Vietnamese words\nBasic vocabulary in Vietnamese has Proto-Vietic origins. Vietnamese shares a large amount of vocabulary with the M\u01b0\u1eddng languages, a close relative of the Vietnamese language.\n\nOther compound words, such as n\u01b0\u1edbc non (ch\u1eef N\u00f4m: \u6e03\ud847\udf6b, \"country/nation\", lit. \"water and mountains\"), appear to be of purely Vietnamese origin and used to be inscribed in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m characters (compounded, self-coined Chinese characters) but are now written in the Vietnamese alphabet.\n\nSlang\nVietnamese slang (ti\u1ebfng l\u00f3ng) has changed over time. Vietnamese slang consists of pure Vietnamese words as well as words borrowed from other languages such as Mandarin or Indo-European languages. It is estimated that Vietnamese slang originating from Mandarin accounts for a tiny proportion (4.6% of surveyed data in newspapers). On the other hand, slang originating from Indo-European languages accounts for a more significant proportion (12%) and is much more common in today's usage. Slang borrowed from these languages can be either transliteral or vernacular. Some examples:\n\nWith the rise of the Internet, new slang is generated and popularized through social media. This modern slang is commonly used in the younger generation's teenspeak in Vietnam. This recent slang is mostly pure Vietnamese, and almost all the words are homonyms or some form of wordplay. Some slang words may include profanity swear words (derogatory) or just a play on words.\nSome examples with newer and older slang that originate from northern, central, or southern Vietnamese dialects include:\n\nWhilst older slang has been used by previous generations, the prevalence of modern slang used by young people in Vietnam (as teenspeak) has made conversations more difficult for older generations to understand. This has become subject for debate. Some believe that incorporating teenspeak or internet slang in daily conversation among teenagers will affect the formality and cadence of their general speech. Others argue that it is not slang that is the problem, but rather the lack of communication techniques for the instant internet messaging era. They believe slang should not be dismissed, but instead, youth should be adequately informed to recognise when to use it and when it is inappropriate.\n\nWriting systems\nAfter ending a millennium of Chinese rule in 939, the Vietnamese state adopted Literary Chinese (called v\u0103n ng\u00f4n \u6587\u8a00 or H\u00e1n v\u0103n \u6f22\u6587 in Vietnamese) for official purposes.\nUp to the late 19th century (except for two brief interludes), all formal writing, including government business, scholarship and formal literature, was done in Literary Chinese, written with Chinese characters (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n). Although the writing system is now mostly in ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef (Latin script), Chinese script known as ch\u1eef H\u00e1n in Vietnamese as well as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m (together, H\u00e1n-N\u00f4m) is still present in such activities such as Vietnamese calligraphy.\n\nCh\u1eef N\u00f4m\nFrom around the 13th century, Vietnamese scholars used their knowledge of the Chinese script to develop the ch\u1eef N\u00f4m (lit.\u2009'Southern characters') script to record folk literature in Vietnamese. The script used Chinese characters to represent both borrowed Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary and native words with similar pronunciation or meaning. In addition, thousands of new compound characters were created to write Vietnamese words using a variety of methods, including phono-semantic compounds.\nFor example, in the opening lines of the classic poem The Tale of Ki\u1ec1u,\n\nthe Sino-Vietnamese word m\u1ec7nh 'destiny' was written with its original character \u547d;\nthe native Vietnamese word ta 'our' was written with the character \u4e9b of the homophonous Sino-Vietnamese word ta 'little, few; rather, somewhat';\nthe native Vietnamese word n\u0103m 'year' was written with a new character \ud848\udda5 that is compounded from \u5357 nam and \u5e74 'year'.\nThe oldest example of an early form of the N\u00f4m is found in a list of names in the Th\u00e1p Mi\u1ebfu Temple Inscription, dating from the early 13th century AD.\nN\u00f4m writing reached its zenith in the 18th century when many Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in N\u00f4m, most notably Nguy\u1ec5n Du and H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng (dubbed \"the Queen of N\u00f4m poetry\"). However, it was only used for official purposes during the brief H\u1ed3 and T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasties (1400\u20131406 and 1778\u20131802 respectively).\nA Vietnamese Catholic, Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng T\u1ed9, unsuccessfully petitioned the Court suggesting the adoption of a script for Vietnamese based on Chinese characters.\n\nVietnamese alphabet\nA romanisation of Vietnamese was codified in the 17th century by the Avignonese Jesuit missionary Alexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131660), based on works of earlier Portuguese missionaries, particularly Francisco de Pina, Gaspar do Amaral and Antonio Barbosa.\nIt reflects a \"Middle Vietnamese\" dialect close to the Hanoi variety as spoken in the 17th century. Its vowels and final consonants correspond most closely to northern dialects while its initial consonants are most similar to southern dialects. (This is not unlike how English orthography is based on the Chancery Standard of Late Middle English, with many spellings retained even after the Great Vowel Shift.)\nThe Vietnamese alphabet contains 29 letters, supplementing the Latin alphabet with an additional consonant letter (\u0111) and 6 additional vowel letters (\u0103, \u00e2/\u00ea/\u00f4, \u01a1, \u01b0) formed with diacritics. The Latin letters f, j, w and z are not used.\nThe script also represents additional phonemes using ten digraphs (ch, gh, gi, kh, ng, nh, ph, qu, th, and tr) and a single trigraph (ngh).\nFurther diacritics are used to indicate the tone of each syllable:\n\nThus, it is possible for diacritics to be stacked e.g. \u1ec3, combining letter with diacritic, \u00ea, with diacritic for tone, \u1ebb, to make \u1ec3.\nDespite the missionaries' creation of the alphabetic script, ch\u1eef N\u00f4m remained the dominant script in Vietnamese Catholic literature for more than 200 years. Starting from the late 19th century, the Vietnamese alphabet (ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef or 'national language script') gradually expanded from its initial usage in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public.\nThe romanised script became predominant over the course of the early 20th century, when education became widespread and a simpler writing system was found to be more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population. The French colonial administration sought to eliminate Chinese writing, Confucianism, and other Chinese influences from Vietnam. French superseded Literary Chinese in administration. Vietnamese written with the alphabet became required for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French R\u00e9sident Sup\u00e9rieur of the protectorate of Tonkin. In turn, Vietnamese reformists and nationalists themselves encouraged and popularized the use of ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef. By the middle of the 20th century, most writing was done in ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, which became the official script on independence.\nNevertheless, ch\u1eef H\u00e1n was still in use during the French colonial period and as late as World War II was still featured on banknotes, but fell out of official and mainstream use shortly thereafter. The education reform by North Vietnam in 1950 eliminated the use of ch\u1eef H\u00e1n and ch\u1eef N\u00f4m. Today, only a few scholars and some extremely elderly people are able to read ch\u1eef N\u00f4m or use it in Vietnamese calligraphy. Priests of the Jing minority in China (descendants of 16th-century migrants from Vietnam) use songbooks and scriptures written in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m in their ceremonies.\n\nComputer support\nThe Unicode character set contains all Vietnamese characters and the Vietnamese currency symbol. On systems that do not support Unicode, many 8-bit Vietnamese code pages are available such as Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange (VSCII) or Windows-1258. Where ASCII must be used, Vietnamese letters are often typed using the VIQR convention, though this is largely unnecessary with the increasing ubiquity of Unicode. There are many software tools that help type Roman-script Vietnamese on English keyboards, such as WinVNKey and Unikey on Windows, or MacVNKey on Macintosh, with popular methods of encoding Vietnamese using Telex, VNI or VIQR input methods all included. Telex input method is often set as the default for many devices. Besides third-party software tools, operating systems such as Windows or macOS can also be installed with Vietnamese and Vietnamese keyboard, e.g. Vietnamese Telex in Microsoft Windows.\n\nDates and numbers writing formats\nVietnamese speak date in the format \"day month year\". Each month's name is just the ordinal of that month appended after the word th\u00e1ng, which means \"month\". Traditional Vietnamese, however, assigns other names to some months; these names are mostly used in the lunar calendar and in poetry.\n\nWhen written in the short form, \"DD/MM/YYYY\" is preferred.\nExample:\n\nEnglish: 28 March 2018\nVietnamese long form: Ng\u00e0y 28 th\u00e1ng 3 n\u0103m 2018\nVietnamese short form: 28/3/2018\nThe Vietnamese prefer writing numbers with a comma as the decimal separator in lieu of dots, and either spaces or dots to group the digits. An example is 1 629,15 (one thousand six hundred twenty-nine point one five). Because a comma is used as the decimal separator, a semicolon is used to separate two numbers instead.\n\nLiterature\nThe Tale of Ki\u1ec1u is an epic narrative poem by the celebrated poet Nguy\u1ec5n Du, (\u962e\u6538), which is often considered the most significant work of Vietnamese literature. It was originally written in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m (titled \u0110o\u1ea1n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng T\u00e2n Thanh \u65b7\u8178\u65b0\u8072) and is widely taught in Vietnam (in ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef transliteration).\n\nLanguage variation\nCurrently the Ngu\u1ed3n language is considered by the Vietnamese government to be a dialect of Vietnamese, however it is also considered a separate Vi\u1ec7t-M\u01b0\u1eddng language or the southernmost dialect of M\u01b0\u1eddng language. The Vietnamese language also has several mutually intelligible regional varieties:\n\nVietnamese has traditionally been divided into three dialect regions: North (45%), Central (10%), and South (45%). Michel Ferlus and Nguy\u1ec5n T\u00e0i C\u1ea9n found that there was a separate North-Central dialect for Vietnamese as well. The term Haut-Annam refers to dialects spoken from the northern Ngh\u1ec7 An Province to the southern (former) Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Province that preserve archaic features (like consonant clusters and undiphthongized vowels) that have been lost in other modern dialects.\nThe dialect regions differ mostly in their sound systems (see below) but also in vocabulary (including basic and non-basic vocabulary) and grammar. The North-Central and the Central regional varieties, which have a significant number of vocabulary differences, are generally less mutually intelligible to Northern and Southern speakers. There is less internal variation within the Southern region than the other regions because of its relatively late settlement by Vietnamese-speakers (around the end of the 15th century). The North-Central region is particularly conservative since its pronunciation has diverged less from Vietnamese orthography than the other varieties, which tend to merge certain sounds. Along the coastal areas, regional variation has been neutralized to a certain extent, but more mountainous regions preserve more variation. As for sociolinguistic attitudes, the North-Central varieties are often felt to be \"peculiar\" or \"difficult to understand\" by speakers of other dialects although their pronunciation fits the written language the most closely; that is typically because of various words in their vocabulary that are unfamiliar to other speakers (see the example vocabulary table below).\n\nThe large movements of people between North and South since the mid-20th century has resulted in a sizable number of Southern residents speaking in the Northern accent/dialect and, to a greater extent, Northern residents speaking in the Southern accent/dialect. After the Geneva Accords of 1954, which called for the temporary division of the country, about a million northerners (mainly from Hanoi, Haiphong, and the surrounding Red River Delta areas) moved south (mainly to Saigon and heavily to Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the surrounding areas) as part of Operation Passage to Freedom. About 180,000 moved in the reverse direction (T\u1eadp k\u1ebft ra B\u1eafc, literally \"go to the North\".)\nAfter the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Northern and North-Central speakers from the densely-populated Red River Delta and the traditionally-poorer provinces of Ngh\u1ec7 An, H\u00e0 T\u0129nh, and Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh have continued to move south to look for better economic opportunities allowed by the new government's New Economic Zones, a program that lasted from 1975 to 1985. The first half of the program (1975\u20131980) resulted in 1.3 million people sent to the New Economic Zones (NEZs), most of which were relocated to the southern half of the country in previously uninhabited areas, and 550,000 of them were Northerners. The second half (1981\u20131985) saw almost 1 million Northerners relocated to the New Economic Zones. Government and military personnel from Northern and North-Central Vietnam are also posted to various locations throughout the country that were often away from their home regions. More recently, the growth of the free market system has resulted in increased interregional movement and relations between distant parts of Vietnam through business and travel. The movements have also resulted in some blending of dialects and more significantly have made the Northern dialect more easily understood in the South and vice versa. Most Southerners, when singing modern/old popular Vietnamese songs or addressing the public, do so in the standardized accent if possible, which uses the Northern pronunciation. That is true in both Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese communities.\nModern Standard Vietnamese is based on the Hanoi dialect. Nevertheless, the major dialects are still predominant in their respective areas and have also evolved over time with influences from other areas. Historically, accents have been distinguished by how each region pronounces the letters d ([z] in the Northern dialect and [j] in the Central and Southern dialect) and r ([z] in the Northern dialect and [r] in the Central and Southern dialects). Thus, the Central and the Southern dialects can be said to have retained a pronunciation closer to Vietnamese orthography and resemble how Middle Vietnamese sounded, in contrast to the modern Northern (Hanoi) dialect, which has since undergone pronunciation shifts.\n\nVocabulary\nAlthough regional variations developed over time, most of those words can be used interchangeably and be understood well, albeit with more or less frequency then others or with slightly different but often discernible word choices and pronunciations. Some accents may mix, with words such d\u1ea1 v\u00e2ng combining d\u1ea1 and v\u00e2ng, being created.\n\nConsonants\nThe syllable-initial ch and tr digraphs are pronounced distinctly in the North-Central, Central, and Southern varieties but are merged in Northern varieties, which pronounce them the same way). Many North-Central varieties preserve three distinct pronunciations for d, gi, and r, but the Northern varieties have a three-way merger, and the Central and the Southern varieties have a merger of d and gi but keep r distinct. At the end of syllables, the palatals ch and nh have merged with the alveolars t and n, which, in turn, have also partially merged with velars c and ng in the Central and the Southern varieties.\n\nIn addition to the regional variation described above, there is a merger of l and n in certain rural varieties in the North:\n\nVariation between l and n can be found even in mainstream Vietnamese in certain words. For example, the numeral \"five\" appears as n\u0103m by itself and in compound numerals like n\u0103m m\u01b0\u01a1i \"fifty\", but it appears as l\u0103m in m\u01b0\u1eddi l\u0103m \"fifteen\" (see Vietnamese grammar#Cardinal). In some northern varieties, the numeral appears with an initial nh instead of l: hai m\u01b0\u01a1i nh\u0103m \"twenty-five\", instead of the mainstream hai m\u01b0\u01a1i l\u0103m.\nThere is also a merger of r and g in certain rural varieties in the South:\n\nThe consonant clusters that were originally present in Middle Vietnamese (in the 17th century) have been lost in almost all modern Vietnamese varieties although they have been retained in other closely related Vietic languages. However, some speech communities have preserved some of these archaic clusters: \"sky\" is bl\u1eddi with a cluster in H\u1ea3o Nho (Y\u00ean M\u00f4, Ninh B\u00ecnh Province) but tr\u1eddi in Southern Vietnamese and gi\u1eddi in Hanoi Vietnamese (initial single consonants /\u0288/, /z/, respectively).\n\nTones\nThere are six tones in Vietnamese, with phonetic differences between dialects, mostly in the pitch contour and phonation type.\n\nThe table above shows the pitch contour of each tone using Chao tone number notation in which 1 represents the lowest pitch, and 5 the highest; glottalization (creaky, stiff, harsh) is indicated with the \u27e8\u25cc\u0330\u27e9 symbol; murmured voice with \u27e8\u25cc\u0324\u27e9; glottal stop with \u27e8\u0294\u27e9; sub-dialectal variants are separated with commas. (See also the tone section below.)\n\nWord play\nA basic form of word play in Vietnamese involves disyllabic words in which the last syllable forms the first syllable of the next word in the chain. This game involves two members versing each other until the opponent is unable to think of another word. For instance: \n\nAnother language game known as n\u00f3i l\u00e1i is used by Vietnamese speakers. N\u00f3i l\u00e1i involves switching, adding or removing the tones in a pair of words and may also involve switching the order of words or the first consonant and the rime of each word. Some examples:\n\nThe resulting transformed phrase often has a different meaning but sometimes may just be a nonsensical word pair. N\u00f3i l\u00e1i can be used to obscure the original meaning and thus soften the discussion of a socially sensitive issue, as with d\u1ea5m \u0111\u00e0i and ho\u1ea3ng ch\u01b0a (above), or when implied (and not overtly spoken), to deliver a hidden subtextual message, as with b\u1ed3i t\u00e2y. Naturally, n\u00f3i l\u00e1i can be used for a humorous effect.\nAnother word game somewhat reminiscent of pig latin is played by children. Here a nonsense syllable (chosen by the child) is prefixed onto a target word's syllables, then their initial consonants and rimes are switched with the tone of the original word remaining on the new switched rime.\n\nThis language game is often used as a \"secret\" or \"coded\" language useful for obscuring messages from adult comprehension.\n\nSee also\nVietnamese Wikipedia\nVietnamese calligraphy\nVietnamese pronouns\nVietnamese studies\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nGeneral\nD\u01b0\u01a1ng, Qu\u1ea3ng-H\u00e0m.

Here is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article:\n\n### Phonology\n\n#### Vowels\n- Vietnamese has a large number of vowels, including front and central vowels (i, \u00ea, e, \u01b0, \u00e2, \u01a1, \u0103, a) which are unrounded, and back vowels (u, \u00f4, o) which are rounded.\n- The vowels \u00e2 [\u0259] and \u0103 [a] are pronounced very short compared to other vowels.\n- Centering diphthongs are formed with high vowels (i, \u01b0, u) and are spelled as ia, \u01b0a, ua when ending a word, and i\u00ea, \u01b0\u01a1, u\u00f4 when followed by a consonant.\n- Closing diphthongs and triphthongs consist of a main vowel followed by a semivowel offglide /j/ or /w/. Restrictions include /j/ not occurring after a front vowel and /w/ not occurring after a back vowel.\n\n#### Consonants\n- Consonants are represented in Vietnamese orthography with phonetic pronunciation. Some are written with single letters (e.g., \"p\"), digraphs (e.g., \"ph\"), or multiple letters (e.g., \"c\", \"k\", \"q\" for the velar stop).\n- Syllable-final orthographic ch and nh have different analyses, either as phonemes /c/, /\u0272/ or as allophonic variants of /k/ and /\u014b/ after certain vowels.\n\n#### Tones\n- Vietnamese is a tonal language with six tones in northern varieties, indicated by diacritics above or below the vowel.\n- Tones differ in length, pitch contour, pitch height, and phonation.\n- Old tonal classification used Chinese system, with eight tones classified into two main groups: b\u1eb1ng (level tones) and tr\u1eafc (sharp tones).\n\n### Grammar\n\n- Vietnamese is an analytic language with subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order, head-initial directionality, and a noun classifier system.\n- It does not use morphological marking for case, gender, number, or tense.\n- Vietnamese allows for pro-drop, wh-in-situ, and verb serialization.\n\n### Lexicon\n\n#### Austroasiatic Origins\n- Vietnamese has Austroasiatic roots, with some of the oldest words being Austroasiatic in origin.\n\n#### Chinese Influence\n- Significant Chinese influence, especially during periods of Chinese rule, leading to Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary.\n- Three major classes of Sino-Vietnamese borrowings: Early, Late, and Recent Sino-Vietnamese.\n\n#### French Influence\n- French colonial period introduced many French terms into Vietnamese, such as \"c\u00e0 ph\u00ea\" (coffee) and \"ph\u00f4 mai\" (cheese).\n\n#### English and Japanese Influence\n- English loanwords include \"tivi\" (TV) and calques like \"ph\u1ea7n m\u1ec1m\" (software).\n- Japanese loanwords include terms like \"kimono\" and \"sumo,\" with some borrowed indirectly through Chinese.\n\n### Writing Systems\n\n#### Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m\n- Developed from Chinese characters to record Vietnamese folk literature, using both borrowed and newly created characters.\n\n#### Vietnamese Alphabet\n- Romanized script codified in the 17th century, based on Middle Vietnamese dialect.\n- Contains 29 letters, with additional consonant and vowel letters formed with diacritics.\n- Uses digraphs and a trigraph to represent additional phonemes.\n\n### Language Variation\n\n- Vietnamese has several mutually intelligible regional varieties: North, Central, and South.\n- Dialect regions differ in sound systems, vocabulary, and grammar.\n- Modern Standard Vietnamese is based on the Hanoi dialect, but regional dialects remain predominant in their areas.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n\n- Dates are spoken in \"day month year\" format, and numbers use a comma as the decimal separator.\n- Vietnamese slang includes both pure Vietnamese words and borrowings from other languages, with modern slang popularized through social media.\n\nThis detailed understanding of Vietnamese phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and writing systems will be crucial for accurate translation into Vietnamese.", "updated": "2025-03-04T21:26:06.849559"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language": {"base_content": "Mongolian is the principal language of the Mongolic language family that originated in the Mongolian Plateau. It is spoken by ethnic Mongols and other closely related Mongolic peoples who are native to modern Mongolia and surrounding parts of East and North Asia. Mongolian is the official language of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia and a recognized language of Xinjiang and Qinghai.\nThe number of speakers across all its dialects may be 5\u20136 million, including the vast majority of the residents of Mongolia and many of the ethnic Mongol residents of the Inner Mongolia of China. In Mongolia, Khalkha Mongolian is predominant, and is currently written in both Cyrillic and the traditional Mongolian script. In Inner Mongolia, it is dialectally more diverse and written in the traditional Mongolian script. However, Mongols in both countries often use the Latin script for convenience on the Internet.\nIn the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is the standard written Khalkha formalized in the writing conventions and in grammar as taught in schools, but much of it is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar Mongolian.\nSome classify several other Mongolic languages like Buryat and Oirat as varieties of Mongolian, but this classification is not in line with the current international standard.\nMongolian is a language with vowel harmony and a complex syllabic structure compared to other Mongolic languages, allowing clusters of up to three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject\u2013object\u2013verb, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, as grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.\nModern Mongolian evolved from Middle Mongol, the language spoken in the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries. In the transition, a major shift in the vowel-harmony paradigm occurred, long vowels developed, the case system changed slightly, and the verbal system was restructured. Mongolian is related to the extinct Khitan language. It was believed that Mongolian was related to Turkic, Tungusic, Korean and Japonic languages but this view is now seen as obsolete by a majority of (but not all) comparative linguists. These languages have been grouped under the Altaic language family and contrasted with the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area. However, instead of a common genetic origin, Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak proposed that Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages form a language Sprachbund, rather than common origin. Mongolian literature is well attested in written form from the 13th century but has earlier Mongolic precursors in the literature of the Khitan and other Xianbei peoples. The Bugut inscription dated to 584 CE and the Inscription of H\u00fcis Tolgoi dated to 604\u2013620 CE appear to be the oldest substantial Mongolic or Para-Mongolic texts discovered.\n\nName\nWriters such as Owen Lattimore referred to Mongolian as \"the Mongol language\".\n\nHistory\nThe earliest surviving Mongolian text may be the Stele of Yis\u00fcngge, a report on sports composed in Mongolian script on stone, which is most often dated at 1224 or 1225. The Mongolian-Armenian wordlist of 55 words compiled by Kirakos of Gandzak (13th century) is the first written record of Mongolian words. From the 13th to the 15th centuries, Mongolian language texts were written in four scripts (not counting some vocabulary written in Western scripts): Uyghur Mongolian (UM) script (an adaptation of the Uyghur alphabet ), 'Phags-pa script (Ph) (used in decrees), Chinese (SM) (The Secret History of the Mongols), and Arabic (AM) (used in dictionaries). While they are the earliest texts available, these texts have come to be called \"Middle Mongol\" in scholarly practice. The documents in UM script show some distinct linguistic characteristics and are therefore often distinguished by terming their language \"Preclassical Mongolian\".\nThe Yuan dynasty referred to the Mongolian language in Chinese as \"Guoyu\" (Chinese: \u570b\u8a9e), which means \"National language\", a term also used by other non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages such as the Manchu language during the Qing dynasty, the Jurchen language during the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), the Khitan language during the Liao dynasty, and the Xianbei language during the Northern Wei period.\nThe next distinct period is Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language with a high degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.\n\nGeographic distribution\nMongolian is the official national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not always written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and the official provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, where there are at least 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols so they can benefit from the preferential policies for minorities in education, healthcare, family planning, school admissions, the hiring and promotion, the financing and taxation of businesses, and regional infrastructural support given to ethnic minorities in China. In 2020, the Chinese government required three subjects\u2014language and literature, politics, and history\u2014to be taught in Mandarin in Mongolian-language primary and secondary schools in the Inner Mongolia since September, which caused widespread protests among ethnic Mongol communities. These protests were quickly suppressed by the Chinese government. Mandarin has been deemed the only language of instruction for all subjects as of September 2023.\n\nClassification and varieties\nMongolian belongs to the Mongolic languages. The delimitation of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded by the fact that existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.\nIn Juha Janhunen's book titled Mongolian, he groups the Mongolic language family into four distinct linguistic branches:\n\nthe Dagur branch, made up of just the Dagur language, which is spoken in the northeast area of Manchuria in China, specifically in Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner of Hulunbuir, and in Meilisi Daur District of Qiqihar, Heilongjiang;\nthe Moghol branch, made up of just the Moghol language, spoken in Afghanistan, and is possibly extinct;\nthe Shirongolic (or Southern Mongolic) branch, made up of roughly seven languages, which are spoken in the Amdo region of Tibet;\nthe Common Mongolic (or Central Mongolic) branch, made up of roughly six language varieties, to which Mongolian proper belongs.\nThe Common Mongolic branch is grouped in the following way:\n\nKhalkha (Halh) is spoken in Mongolia, but some dialects (e.g. Cahar) are also spoken in the Inner Mongolia region of China.\nKhorchin (Horchin) is spoken to the east in eastern Inner Mongolia and Manchuria.\nOrdos is spoken to the south, in Ordos City in Inner Mongolia.\nOirat, is spoken to the west, in Dzungaria.\nKhamnigan (Hamnigan) is spoken in northeast Mongolia and in northwest of Manchuria.\nBuryat (Buriad) is spoken to the north, in the Republic of Buryatia of Russia, as well as in the Barga region of Hulun Buir League in Inner Mongolia.\nThere is no disagreement that the Khalkha dialect of the Mongolian state is Mongolian. However, the status of certain varieties in the Common Mongolic group\u2014whether they are languages distinct from Mongolian or just dialects of it\u2014is disputed. There are at least three such varieties: Oirat (including the Kalmyk variety) and Buryat, both of which are spoken in Russia, Mongolia, and China; and Ordos, spoken around Inner Mongolia's Ordos City. The influential classification of San\u017eeev (1953) proposed a \"Mongolian language\" consisting of just the three dialects Khalkha, Chakhar, and Ordos, with Buryat and Oirat judged to be independent languages. On the other hand, Luvsanvandan (1959) proposed a much broader \"Mongolian language\" consisting of a Central dialect (Khalkha, Chakhar, Ordos), an Eastern dialect (Kharchin, Khorchin), a Western dialect (Oirat, Kalmyk), and a Northern dialect (consisting of two Buryat varieties). Additionally, the Language Policy in the People's Republic of China: Theory and Practice Since 1949, states that Mongolian can be classified into four dialects: the Khalkha dialect in the middle, the Horcin-Haracin dialect in the East, Oriat-Hilimag in the west, and Bargu\u2013Buriyad in the north.\nSome Western scholars propose that the relatively well researched Ordos variety is an independent language due to its conservative syllable structure and phoneme inventory. While the placement of a variety like Alasha, which is under the cultural influence of Inner Mongolia but historically tied to Oirat, and of other border varieties like Darkhad would very likely remain problematic in any classification, the central problem remains the question of how to classify Chakhar, Khalkha, and Khorchin in relation to each other and in relation to Buryat and Oirat. The split of [t\u0283] into [t\u0283] before *i and [ts] before all other reconstructed vowels, which is found in Mongolia but not in Inner Mongolia, is often cited as a fundamental distinction, for example Proto-Mongolic *t\u0283il, Khalkha /t\u0283i\u026e/, Chakhar /t\u0283il/ 'year' versus Proto-Mongolic *t\u0283\u00f8helen, Khalkha /tso\u02d0\u026e\u0259\u014b/, Chakhar /t\u0283o\u02d0l\u0259\u014b/ 'few'. On the other hand, the split between the past tense verbal suffixes -/s\u014b/ in the Central varieties v. -/d\u0292\u025b\u02d0/ in the Eastern varieties is usually seen as a merely stochastic difference.\nIn Inner Mongolia, official language policy divides the Mongolian language into three dialects: Standard Mongolian of Inner Mongolia, Oirat, and Barghu-Buryat. The Standard Mongolian of Inner Mongolia is said to consist of Chakhar, Ordos, Baarin, Khorchin, Kharchin, and Alasha. The authorities have synthesized a literary standard for Mongolian in whose grammar is said to be based on the Standard Mongolian of Inner Mongolia and whose pronunciation is based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the Plain Blue Banner. Dialectologically, however, western Mongolian dialects in Inner Mongolia are closer to Khalkha than they are to eastern Mongolian dialects in Inner Mongolia: e.g. Chakhar is closer to Khalkha than to Khorchin.\n\nList of dialects\nJuha Janhunen (2003: 179) lists the following Mongol dialects, most of which are spoken in Inner Mongolia.\n\nTongliao group\nHorchin\nJasagtu\nJarut\nJalait\nD\u00f6rbet\nGorlos\nJuu Uda group\nAru Horchin\nBaarin\nOngniut\nNaiman\nAohan\nJosotu group\nHarachin\nT\u00fcmet\nUlan cab group\nCahar\nUrat\nDarhan\nMuumingan\nD\u00f6rben K\u00fc\u00fcket\nKeshigten\nShilingol group\n\u00dcdz\u00fcm\u00fcchin\nHuuchit\nAbaga\nAbaganar\nS\u00f6nit\nOuter Mongolian group\nHalh\nHotogoit\nDarhad\nCongol\nSartul\nDariganga\n\nStandard varieties\nThere are two standard varieties of Mongolian.\n\nMongolia\nStandard Mongolian in the state of Mongolia is based on the northern Khalkha Mongolian dialects, which include the dialect of Ulaanbaatar, and is written in the Mongolian Cyrillic script.\n\nChina\nStandard Mongolian in Inner Mongolia is based on the Chakhar Mongolian of the Khalkha dialect group, spoken in the Shuluun Huh/Zh\u00e8ngl\u00e1n Banner, and is written in the traditional Mongolian script.\nThe number of Mongolian speakers in China is still larger than in the state of Mongolia, where the majority of Mongolians in China speak one of the Khorchin dialects, or rather more than two million of them speak the Khorchin dialect itself as their mother tongue, so that the Khorchin dialect group has about as many speakers as the Khalkha dialect group in the State of Mongolia. Nevertheless, the Chakhar dialect, which today has only about 100,000 native speakers and belongs to the Khalkha dialect group, is the basis of standard Mongolian in China.\n\nDifferences\nThe characteristic differences in the pronunciation of the two standard varieties include the umlauts in Inner Mongolia and the palatalized consonants in Mongolia (see below) as well as the splitting of the Middle Mongol affricates *\u02a7 (\u1834 \u010d) and *\u02a4 (\u1835 \u01f0) into \u02a6 (\u0446 c) and \u02a3 (\u0437 z) versus \u02a7 (\u0447 \u010d) and \u02a4 (\u0436 \u017e) in Mongolia:\n\nAside from these differences in pronunciation, there are also differences in vocabulary and language use: in the state of Mongolia more loanwords from Russian are being used, while in Inner Mongolia more loanwords from Chinese have been adopted.\n\nPhonology\nThe following description is based primarily on the Khalkha dialect as spoken in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital. The phonologies of other varieties such as Ordos, Khorchin, and even Chakhar, differ considerably. This section discusses the phonology of Khalkha Mongolian with subsections on Vowels, Consonants, Phonotactics and Stress.\n\nVowels\nThe standard language has seven monophthong vowel phonemes. They are aligned into three vowel harmony groups by a parameter called ATR (advanced tongue root); the groups are \u2212ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment seems to have superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front vowel spellings '\u00f6' and '\u00fc' are still often used in the West to indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian vowel system also has rounding harmony.\nLength is phonemic for vowels, and except short [e], which has merged into short [i], at least in Ulaanbaatar dialect, each of the other six phonemes occurs both short and long. Phonetically, short /o/ has become centralised to the central vowel [\u0275].\nIn the following table, the seven vowel phonemes, with their length variants, are arranged and described phonetically. The vowels in the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet are: \n\nKhalkha also has four diphthongs: historically /ui, \u028ai, \u0254i, ai/ but are pronounced more like [\u0289e\u032f, \u028ae\u032f, \u025ee\u032f, \u00e6e\u032f]; e.g. \u043e\u0439 in \u043d\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 (nohoi) [n\u0254\u0319\u02c8\u03c7\u025ee\u032f] 'dog', \u0430\u0439 in \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439 (dalai) [ta\u02c8\u026e\u00e6e\u032f] sea', \u0443\u0439 in \u0443\u0439\u043b\u0430\u0445 (uilah) [\u02c8\u028ae\u032f\u026e\u0250\u03c7] 'to cry', \u04af\u0439 in \u04af\u0439\u043b\u0434\u0432\u044d\u0440 (\u00fcildver) [\u02c8\u0289e\u032f\u026etw\u031c\u0258r] 'factory', \u044d\u0439 in \u0445\u044d\u0440\u044d\u0433\u0442\u044d\u0439 (heregtei) [\u00e7i\u027e\u026ax\u02c8t\u02b0e] 'necessary'. There are three additional rising diphthongs /ia/ (\u0438\u0430), /\u028aa/ (\u0443\u0430) /ei/ (\u044d\u0439); e.g. \u0438\u0430 in \u0430\u043c\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0430 (amiaraa) [a\u02c8m\u02b2\u00e6\u027ea] 'individually', \u0443\u0430 in \u0445\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d (huaran) [\u02c8\u03c7\u02b7a\u027e\u0250\u0274] 'barracks'.\n\nAllophones\nThis table below lists vowel allophones (short vowels allophones in non-initial positions are used interchangeably with schwa):\n\nATR harmony\nMongolian divides vowels into three groups in a system of vowel harmony:\n\nFor historical reasons, these have been traditionally labeled as \"front\" vowels and \"back\" vowels, as /o/ and /u/ developed from /\u00f8/ and /y/, while /\u0254/ and /\u028a/ developed from /o/ and /u/ in Middle Mongolian. Indeed, in Mongolian romanizations, the vowels /o/ and /u/ are often conventionally rendered as \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9, while the vowels /\u0254/ and /\u028a/ are expressed as \u27e8o\u27e9 and \u27e8u\u27e9. However, for modern Mongolian phonology, it is more appropriate to instead characterize the two vowel-harmony groups by the dimension of tongue root position. There is also one neutral vowel, /i/, not belonging to either group.\nAll the vowels in a noncompound word, including all its suffixes, must belong to the same group. If the first vowel is \u2212ATR, then every vowel of the word must be either /i/ or a \u2212ATR vowel. Likewise, if the first vowel is a +ATR vowel, then every vowel of the word must be either /i/ or a +ATR vowel. In the case of suffixes, which must change their vowels to conform to different words, two patterns predominate. Some suffixes contain an archiphoneme /A/ that can be realized as /a, \u0254, e, o/; e.g.\n\n/orx/ 'household' + -Ar (instrumental) \u2192 /orxor/ 'by a household'\n/xar\u028a\u026e/ 'sentry' + -Ar (instrumental) \u2192 /xar\u028a\u026ear/ 'by a sentry'\nOther suffixes can occur in /U/ being realized as /\u028a, u/, in which case all \u2212ATR vowels lead to /\u028a/ and all +ATR vowels lead to /u/; e.g.\n\n/aw/ 'to take\"l' + -U\u026e (causative) \u2192 /aw\u028a\u026e/\nIf the only vowel in the word stem is /i/, the suffixes will use the +ATR suffix forms.\n\nRounding harmony\nMongolian also has rounding harmony, which does not apply to close vowels. If a stem contains /o/ (or /\u0254/), a suffix that is specified for an open vowel will have [o] (or [\u0254], respectively) as well. However, this process is blocked by the presence of /u/ (or /\u028a/) and /ei/; e.g. /\u0254r-\u026e\u0254/ 'came in', but /\u0254r-\u028a\u026e-\u026ea/ 'inserted'.\n\nVowel length\nThe pronunciation of long and short vowels depends on the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables, there is a phonemic contrast in vowel length. A long vowel has about 208% the length of a short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.\n\nConsonants\nThe following table lists the consonants of Khalkha Mongolian. The consonants enclosed in parentheses occur only in loanwords. The occurrence of palatalized consonant phonemes, except /t\u0283/ /t\u0283\u02b0/ /\u0283/ /j/, is restricted to words with [\u2212ATR] vowels.\n\nA rare feature among the world's languages, Mongolian has neither a voiced lateral approximant, such as [l], nor the voiceless velar plosive [k]; instead, it has a voiced alveolar lateral fricative, /\u026e/, which is often realized as voiceless [\u026c]. In word-final position, /n/ (if not followed by a vowel in historical forms) is realized as [\u014b]. Aspirated consonants are preaspirated in medial and word-final contexts, devoicing preceding consonants and vowels. Devoiced short vowels are often deleted.\n\nSyllable structure and phonotactics\nThe maximal syllable is CVVCCC, where the last C is a word-final suffix. A single short vowel rarely appears in syllable-final position. If a word was monosyllabic historically, *CV has become CVV. In native words, the following consonants do not occur word-initially: /w\u031c/, /\u026e/, /r/, /w\u031c\u02b2/, /\u026e\u02b2/, /r\u02b2/, /t\u02b0\u02b2/, and /t\u02b2/. [\u014b] is restricted to codas (else it becomes [n]), and /p/ and /p\u02b2/ do not occur in codas for historical reasons. For two-consonant clusters, the following restrictions obtain:\n\na palatalized consonant can be preceded only by another palatalized consonant or sometimes by /\u0262/ and /\u0283/\n/\u014b/ may precede only /\u0283, x, \u0261, \u0261\u02b2/ and /\u0262/\n/j/ does not seem to appear in second position\n/p/ and /p\u02b2/ do not occur as first consonant and as second consonant only if preceded by /m/ or /\u026e/ or their palatalized counterparts.\nClusters that do not conform to these restrictions will be broken up by an epenthetic nonphonemic vowel in a syllabification that takes place from right to left. For instance, hoyor 'two', azhil 'work', and saarmag 'neutral' are, phonemically, /x\u0254jr/, /at\u0283\u026e/, and /sa\u02d0rm\u0261/ respectively. In such cases, an epenthetic vowel is inserted to prevent disallowed consonant clusters. Thus, in the examples given above, the words are phonetically [\u02c8x\u0254j\u0254\u0306r], [\u02c8at\u0283\u012d\u026e], and [\u02c8sa\u02d0rm\u0103\u0262]. The phonetic form of the epenthetic vowel follows from vowel harmony triggered by the vowel in the preceding syllable. Usually it is a centralized version of the same sound, with the following exceptions: preceding /u/ produces [e]; /i/ will be ignored if there is a nonneutral vowel earlier in the word; and a postalveolar or palatalized consonant will be followed by an epenthetic [i], as in [\u02c8at\u0283\u012d\u026e].\n\nStress\nStress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not distinguish different meanings) and thus is considered to depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.\nWalker (1997) proposes that stress falls on the rightmost heavy syllable unless this syllable is word-final:\n\nA \"heavy syllable\" is defined as one that is at least the length of a full vowel; short word-initial syllables are thereby excluded. If a word is bisyllabic and the only heavy syllable is word-final, it gets stressed anyway. In cases where there is only one phonemic short word-initial syllable, even this syllable can get the stress:\n\nMore recently, the most extensive collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies has been applied to a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.\n\nGrammar\nThe grammar in this article is also based primarily on Khalkha Mongolian. Unlike the phonology, most of what is said about morphology and syntax also holds true for Chakhar, while Khorchin is somewhat more diverse.\n\nMorphology\nModern Mongolian is an agglutinative\u2014almost exclusively suffixing\u2014language, with the only exception being reduplication. Mongolian also does not have gendered nouns, or definite articles like \"the\". Most of the suffixes consist of a single morpheme. There are many derivational morphemes. For example, the word baiguullagiinh consists of the root bai 'to be', an epenthetic \u2011g\u2011, the causative \u2011uul\u2011 (hence 'to cause to be', to found), the derivative suffix \u2011laga that forms nouns created by the action (like -ation in organisation) and the complex suffix \u2011iinh denoting something that belongs to the modified word (\u2011iin would be genitive).\nNominal compounds are quite frequent. Some derivational verbal suffixes are rather productive, e.g. yarih 'to speak', yarilc 'to speak with each other'. Formally, the independent words derived using verbal suffixes can roughly be divided into three classes: final verbs, which can only be used sentence-finally, i.e. \u2011na (mainly future or generic statements) or \u2011\u00f6 (second person imperative); participles (often called \"verbal nouns\"), which can be used clause-finally or attributively, i.e. \u2011san (perfect-past) or \u2011maar 'want to'; and converbs, which can link clauses or function adverbially, i.e. \u2011zh (qualifies for any adverbial function or neutrally connects two sentences) or \u2011tal (the action of the main clause takes place until the action expressed by the suffixed verb begins).\n\nNouns\nRoughly speaking, Mongolian has between seven and nine cases: nominative (unmarked), genitive, dative-locative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative, privative and directive, though the final two are not always considered part of the case paradigm. If a direct object is definite, it must take the accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is indefinite. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern the genitive, dative-locative, comitative and privative cases, including a marked form of the nominative (which can itself then take further case forms). There is also a possible attributive case (when a noun is used attributively), which is unmarked in most nouns but takes the suffix \u2011\u043d (\u2011n) when the stem has an unstable nasal. Nouns can also take a reflexive-possessive suffix, indicating that the marked noun is possessed by the subject of the sentence: bi najz-aa avar-san I friend-reflexive-possessive save-perfect \"I saved my friend\". However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis.\n\nThe rules governing the morphology of Mongolian case endings are intricate, and so the rules given below are only indicative. In many situations, further (more general) rules must also be taken into account in order to produce the correct form: these include the presence of an unstable nasal or unstable velar, as well as the rules governing when a penultimate vowel should be deleted from the stem with certain case endings (e.g. \u0446\u044d\u0440\u044d\u0433 (tsereg) \u2192 \u0446\u044d\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439\u043d (tsergiin)). The additional morphological rules specific to loanwords are not covered.\n\nNominative case\nThe nominative case is used when a noun (or other part of speech acting as one) is the subject of the sentence, and the agent of whatever action (not just physically) takes place in the sentence. In Mongolian, the nominative case does not have an ending.\n\nAccusative case\nThe accusative case is used when a noun acts as a direct object (or just \"object\"), and receives action from a transitive verb. It is formed by:\n\n\u2011\u0433 (\u2011g) after stems ending in long vowels or diphthongs, or when a stem ending in \u043d (n) has an unstable velar (unstable g).\n\u2011\u044b\u0433 (\u2011iig) after back vowel stems ending in unpalatalized consonants (except \u0433 and \u043a), short vowels (except \u0438) or iotated vowels.\n\u2011\u0438\u0439\u0433 (\u2011iig) after front vowel stems ending in consonants, short vowels or iotated vowels; and after all stems ending in the palatalized consonants \u0436 (j), \u0447 (ch) and \u0448 (sh), as well as \u0433 (g), \u043a (k), \u0438 (i) or \u044c (i).\nNote: If the stem ends in a short vowel or \u044c (i), it is replaced by the suffix.\n\nGenitive case\nThe genitive case is used to show possession of something.\n\nFor regular stems, it is formed by:\n\u2011\u043d (\u2011n) after stems ending in the diphthongs \u0430\u0439 (ai), \u043e\u0439 (oi), \u044d\u0439 (ei), \u044f\u0439 (yai), \u0451\u0439 (yoi) or \u0435\u0439 (yei), or the long vowel \u0438\u0439 (ii).\n\u2011\u044b (\u2011ii) after back vowel stems ending in \u043d (n).\n\u2011\u0438\u0439 (\u2011ii) after front vowel stems ending in \u043d (n).\n\u2011\u044b\u043d (\u2011iin) after back vowel stems ending in unpalatalized consonants (except \u043d, \u0433 and \u043a), short vowels (except \u0438) or iotated vowels.\n\u2011\u0438\u0439\u043d (\u2011iin) after front vowel stems ending in consonants (other than \u043d), short vowels or iotated vowels; and after all stems ending in the palatalized consonants \u0436 (j), \u0447 (ch) and \u0448 (sh), as well as \u0433 (g), \u043a (k), \u0438 (i) or \u044c (i).\n\u2011\u0433\u0438\u0439\u043d (\u2011giin) after stems ending in a long vowel (other than \u0438\u0439), or after the diphthongs \u0438\u0430 (ia), \u0438\u043e (io) or \u0438\u0443 (iu).\nNote: If the stem ends in a short vowel or \u044c (i), it is replaced by the suffix.\nFor stems with an unstable nasal (unstable n), it is formed by:\n\u2011\u043d\u044b (\u2011nii) after back vowel stems (other than those ending in \u0438 or \u044c).\n\u2011\u043d\u0438\u0439 (\u2011nii) after front vowel stems (other than those ending in \u0438 or \u044c).\n\u2011\u0438\u043d\u044b (\u2011inii) after back vowel stems ending in \u0438 (i) or \u044c (i).\n\u2011\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 (\u2011inii) after front vowel stems ending in \u0438 (i) or \u044c (i).\nNote: If the stem ends in \u0438 (i) or \u044c (i), it is replaced by the suffix.\nFor stems with an unstable velar (unstable g), it is formed by \u2011\u0433\u0438\u0439\u043d (\u2011giin).\n\nDative-locative case\nThe dative-locative case is used to show the location of something, or to specify that something is in something else.\n\nFor regular stems or those with an unstable velar (unstable g), it is formed by:\n\u2011\u0434 (\u2011d) after stems ending in vowels or the vocalized consonants \u043b (l), \u043c (m) and \u043d (n), and a small number of stems ending in \u0432 (v) and \u0440 (r).\n\u2011\u0442 (\u2011t) after stems ending in \u0433 (g) and \u043a (k), most stems ending in \u0432 (v) and \u0440 (r), and stems ending in \u0441 (s) when it is preceded by a vowel.\n\u2011\u0438\u0434 (\u2011id) after stems ending in the palatalized consonants \u0436 (j), \u0447 (ch) and \u0448 (sh).\n\u2011\u0430\u0434 (\u2011ad), \u2011\u043e\u0434 (\u2011od), \u2011\u04e9\u0434 (\u2011\u00f6d) or \u2011\u044d\u0434 (\u2011ed) after all other stems (depending on the vowel harmony of the stem).\nFor stems with an unstable nasal (unstable n), it is formed by:\n\u2011\u043d\u0434 (\u2011nd) after stems ending in vowels.\n\u2011\u0438\u043d\u0434 (\u2011ind) after stems ending in the palatalized consonants \u0436 (j), \u0447 (ch) and \u0448 (sh).\n\u2011\u0430\u043d\u0434 (\u2011and), \u2011\u043e\u043d\u0434 (\u2011ond), \u2011\u04e9\u043d\u0434 (\u2011\u00f6nd) or \u2011\u044d\u043d\u0434 (\u2011end) after all other stems (depending on the vowel harmony of the stem).\n\nPlurals\nSource:\nPlurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix. There are four ways of forming plurals in Mongolian:\n\nSome plurals are formed by adding -\u043d\u0443\u0443\u0434 -nuud or -\u043d\u04af\u04af\u0434 -n\u00fc\u00fcd. If the last vowel of the previous word is a (a), o (y), or \u0254 (o), then -\u043d\u0443\u0443\u0434 is used; e.g. \u0445\u0430\u0440x harh 'rat' becomes xap\u0445\u043d\u0443\u0443\u0434 harhnuud 'rats'. If the last vowel of the previous word is e (\u044d), \u028a (\u04e9), \u00fc (\u04af), or i (\u0438) then \u043d\u04af\u04af\u0434 is used; e.g. \u043d\u04af\u0434 n\u00fcd 'eye' becomes \u043d\u04af\u0434\u043d\u04af\u04af\u0434 n\u00fcdn\u00fc\u00fcd 'eyes'.\nIn other plurals, just -\u0443\u0443\u0434 -uud or -\u04af\u04af\u0434 -\u00fc\u00fcd is added without the \"n\"; e.g. \u0445\u043e\u0442 hot 'city' becomes \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0443\u0434 hotuud 'cities', and \u044d\u044d\u0436 eezh 'mother' becomes \u044d\u044d\u0436\u04af\u04af\u0434 eezh\u00fc\u00fcd 'mothers'.\nAnother way of forming plurals is by adding -\u043d\u0430\u0440 -nar; e.g. \u0431\u0430\u0433\u0448 bagsh 'teacher' becomes \u0431\u0430\u0433\u0448 \u043d\u0430\u0440 bagsh nar 'teachers'.\nThe final way is an irregular form used: \u0445\u04af\u043d h\u00fcn 'person' becomes \u0445\u04af\u043c\u04af\u04af\u0441 h\u00fcm\u00fc\u00fcs 'people'.\n\nPronouns\nPersonal pronouns exist for the first and second person, while the old demonstrative pronouns have come to form third person (proximal and distal) pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include interrogative pronouns, conjunctions (which take participles), spatials, and particles, the last being rather numerous.\n\nNegation\nNegation is mostly expressed by -g\u00fci (-\u0433\u04af\u0439) after participles and by the negation particle bish (\u0431\u0438\u0448) after nouns and adjectives; negation particles preceding the verb (for example in converbal constructions) exist, but tend to be replaced by analytical constructions.\n\nNumbers\nForming questions\nWhen asking questions in Mongolian, a question marker is used to show a question is being asked. There are different question markers for yes/no questions and for information questions. For yes/no questions, \u0443\u0443 and \u04af\u04af are used when the last word ends in a short vowel or a consonant, and their use depends on the vowel harmony of the previous word. When the last word ends in a long vowel or a diphthong, then \u044e\u0443 and \u044e\u04af are used (again depending on vowel harmony). For information questions (questions asking for information with an interrogative word like who, what, when, where, why, etc.), the question particles are \u0432\u044d and \u0431\u044d, depending on the last sound in the previous word.\n\nYes/No Question Particles -\u0443\u0443/\u04af\u04af/\u044e\u0443/\u044e\u04af (uu/\u00fc\u00fc/yuu/yu\u00fc)\nOpen Ended Question Particles -\u0431\u044d/\u0432\u044d (be/ve)\nBasic interrogative pronouns -\u044e\u0443 (yuu 'what'), -\u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d\u0430 (haana 'where'), \u0445\u044d\u043d (hen 'who'), \u044f\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0430\u0434 (yaagaad 'why'), \u044f\u0430\u0436 (yaazh 'how'), \u0445\u044d\u0437\u044d\u044d (hezee 'when'), \u044f\u043c\u0430\u0440 (yamar 'what kind')\n\nVerbs\nIn Mongolian, verbs have a stem and an ending. For example, the stems \u0431\u0430\u0439- bai-, \u0441\u0443\u0440- sur-, and \u04af\u0437\u044d- \u00fcze- are suffixed with -\u0445 -h, -\u0430\u0445 -ah, and -\u0445 -h respectively: \u0431\u0430\u0439x baih, \u0441\u0443\u0440ax surah, and \u04af\u0437\u044dx \u00fczeh. These are the infinitive or dictionary forms. The present/future tense is formed by adding -\u043d\u0430 -na, -\u043d\u043e -no, -\u043d\u044d -ne, or -\u043d\u04e9 -n\u00f6 to the stem, for example \u0441\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430 surna 'I/you/he/she/we/they (will) study'. \u0431\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430 baina is the present/future tense verb for 'to be'; likewise, \u0443\u043d\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0430 unshina is 'to read', and \u04af\u0437\u043d\u044d \u00fczne is 'to see'. The final vowel is barely pronounced and is not pronounced at all if the word after begins with a vowel, so \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0431\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0443 sain bain uu is pronounced [s\u00e6e\u032fm\u203fp\u00e6e\u032fn\u203f\u028a\u02d0] 'hello, how are you?'.\n\nPast Tense -\u0441\u0430\u043d/-\u0441\u043e\u043d/-\u0441\u044d\u043d/-\u0441\u04e9\u043d (-san/-son/-sen/-s\u00f6n)\nInformed Past Tense (any point in past) -\u0432 (-v)\nInformed Past Tense (not long ago) -\u043b\u0430\u0430/-\u043b\u043e\u043e/-\u043b\u044d\u044d/-\u043b\u04e9\u04e9 (-laa/-loo/-lee/-l\u00f6\u00f6)\nNon-Informed Past Tense (generally a slightly to relatively more distant past) -\u0436\u044d\u044d/-\u0447\u044d\u044d (-zhee/-chee)\nPresent Perfect Tense -\u0434\u0430\u0433/-\u0434\u043e\u0433/-\u0434\u044d\u0433/-\u0434\u04e9\u0433 (-dag/-dog/-deg/-d\u00f6g)\nPresent Progressive Tense -\u0436/-\u0447 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430 (-zh/-ch baina)\n(Reflective) Present Progressive Tense -\u0430\u0430/-\u043e\u043e/-\u044d\u044d/-\u04e9\u04e9 (-aa/-oo/-ee/-\u00f6\u00f6)\nSimple Present Tense -\u043d\u0430/-\u043d\u043e/-\u043d\u044d/-\u043d\u04e9 (-na/-no/-ne/-n\u00f6)\nSimple Future -\u0445 (\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e) (-h (bolno))\nInfinitive -\u0445 (-h)\n\nNegation\nThere are several ways to form negatives in Mongolian. For example:\n\n\u0431\u0438\u0448 (bish) \u2013 the negative form of the verb 'to be' (\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0445 baih) \u2013 \u0431\u0438\u0448 means 'is/are not'.\n-\u0433\u04af\u0439 (g\u00fci). This suffix is added to verbs, so \u044f\u0432\u0430\u0445 (yawah 'go/will go') becomes \u044f\u0432\u0430\u0445\u0433\u04af\u0439 (yawahg\u00fci 'do not go/will not go').\n\u04af\u0433\u04af\u0439 (\u00fcg\u00fci) is the word for 'no'.\n\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0439 (bitgii) is used for negative imperatives; e.g. \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0432\u0430\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0439 (bitgii yawaarai 'don't go')\n\u0431\u04af\u04af (b\u00fc\u00fc) is the formal version of \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0439.\n\nSyntax\nDifferential case marking\nMongolian uses differential case marking, being a regular differential object marking (DOM) language. DOM emerges from a complicated interaction of factors such as referentiality, animacy and topicality.\nMongolian also exhibits a specific type of differential subject marking (DSM), in which the subjects of embedded clauses (including adverbial clauses) occur with accusative case.\n\nPhrase structure\nThe noun phrase has the order: demonstrative pronoun/numeral, adjective, noun. Attributive sentences precede the whole NP. Titles or occupations of people, low numerals indicating groups, and focus clitics are put behind the head noun. Possessive pronouns (in different forms) may either precede or follow the NP. Examples:\n\nThe verbal phrase consists of the predicate in the center, preceded by its complements and by the adverbials modifying it and followed (mainly if the predicate is sentence-final) by modal particles, as in the following example with predicate bichsen:\n\nIn this clause the adverbial, helehg\u00fcigeer 'without saying [so]' must precede the predicate's complement, \u00fc\u00fcniig 'it-accusative' in order to avoid syntactic ambiguity, since helehg\u00fcigeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an \u00fc\u00fcniig preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.\nFor Khalkha, the most complete treatment of the verbal forms is by Luvsanvandan (ed.) (1987). However, the analysis of predication presented here, while valid for Khalkha, is adapted from the description of Khorchin.\nMost often, of course, the predicate consists of a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, with or without a copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position; e.g.\n\nThe next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, baj- 'to be', e.g.\n\nSuffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect; e.g. progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by baj- may follow, e.g.,\n\nHere, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.\n\nClauses\nUnmarked phrase order is subject\u2013object\u2013predicate. While the predicate generally has to remain in clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear. The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather at the end of the clause. Topic can be overtly marked with bol, which can also mark contrastive focus, overt additive focus ('even, also') can be marked with the clitic ch, and overt restrictive focus with the clitic l ('only').\nThe inventory of voices in Mongolian consists of passive, causative, reciprocal, plurative, and cooperative. In a passive sentence, the verb takes the suffix -gd- and the agent takes either dative or instrumental case, the first of which is more common. In the causative, the verb takes the suffix -uul-, the causee (the person caused to do something) in a transitive action (e.g. 'raise') takes dative or instrumental case, and the causee in an intransitive action (e.g. 'rise') takes accusative case. Causative morphology is also used in some passive contexts:\n\nThe semantic attribute of animacy is syntactically important: thus the sentence, 'the bread was eaten by me', which is acceptable in English, would not be acceptable in Mongolian. The reciprocal voice is marked by -ld-, the plurative by -cgaa-, and the cooperative by -lc-.\nMongolian allows for adjectival depictives that relate to either the subject or the direct object, e.g. Liena n\u00fccgen untdag 'Lena sleeps naked', while adjectival resultatives are marginal.\n\nComplex sentences\nOne way to conjoin clauses is to have the first clause end in a converb, as in the following example using the converb -bol:\n\nSome verbal nouns in the dative (or less often in the instrumental) function very similar to converbs: e.g. replacing olbol in the preceding sentence with olohod find-imperfective-dative yields 'when we find it we'll give it to you'. Quite often, postpositions govern complete clauses. In contrast, conjunctions take verbal nouns without case:\n\nFinally, there is a class of particles, usually clause-initial, that are distinct from conjunctions but that also relate clauses:\n\nMongolian has a complementizer auxiliary verb ge- very similar to Japanese to iu. ge- literally means 'to say' and in converbal form gezh precedes either a psych verb or a verb of saying. As a verbal noun like gedeg (with ni) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As gene it may function as an evidentialis marker.\nMongolian clauses tend to be combined paratactically, which sometimes gives rise to sentence structures which are subordinative despite resembling coordinative structures in European languages:\n\nIn the subordinate clause the subject, if different from the subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as is the case for all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. t\u00fc\u00fcnii idsen hool that.one-genitive eat-perfect meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.\n\nLoanwords and coined words\nMongolian first adopted loanwords from many languages including Old Turkic, Sanskrit (these often via Uyghur), Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, Tungusic, and Chinese. However, more recent loanwords come from Russian, English, and Mandarin Chinese (mainly in Inner Mongolia). Language commissions of the Mongolian state continuously translate new terminology into Mongolian, so as the Mongolian vocabulary now has yer\u00f6nhiil\u00f6gch 'president' ('generalizer') and shar airah 'beer' ('yellow kumys'). There are several loan translations, e.g. galt tereg 'train' ('fire cart') from Chinese hu\u01d2ch\u0113 (\u706b\u8f66 'fire cart') 'train'. Other loan translations include m\u00f6n chanar 'essence' from Chinese sh\u00edzh\u00ec (\u5b9e\u8d28 'true quality'), h\u00fcn am 'population' from Chinese r\u00e9nk\u01d2u (\u4eba\u53e3 'person mouth'), erdene shish 'corn, maize' from Chinese y\u00f9m\u01d0 (\u7389\u7c73 'jade rice') and b\u00fcgd nairamdah uls 'republic' from Chinese g\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 (\u5171\u548c\u56fd 'public collaboration nation').\n\nSanskrit loanwords include shashin (\u0936\u0936\u0928 shashana 'religion'), sansar (\u0938\u0901\u0938\u093e\u0930 sans\u0101ra 'space'), awiyas (\u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938 abhyasa 'talent'), buyan (\u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f punya 'good deeds'), agshin (\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 k\u0161ana 'instant'), tiw (\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a dvipa 'continent'), garig (\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0939 graha 'planet'), cadig (\u091c\u093e\u0924\u0915 j\u0101taka 'tales, stories'), sh\u00fcleg (\u0936\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0915 \u0161loka 'poems, verses'), badag (\u092a\u0926\u0915 padaka 'strophe'), arshan (\u0930\u0938\u093e\u092f\u0928 ra\u0161ayana 'mineral water, nectar'), shastir (\u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 shastra 'chronicle'), bud (\u092c\u0941\u0927 budh 'Mercury'), sugar (\u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0930 shukra 'Venus'), barhasvadi (\u0935\u0943\u0939\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093f vrihaspati 'Jupiter'), and sanchir (\u0936\u0928\u093f shani 'Saturn').\nPersian loanwords include anar (anar 'amethyst'), arhi (araq 'brandy', ultimately from Arabic), baishin (pishiv\u00e2n 'building'), bars (fars 'tiger'), bers (farzin 'chess queen/female tiger'), bold (pul\u00e2d 'steel'), bolor (bolur 'crystal'), gunzhid (konjod 'sesame'), gindan (zend\u00e2n 'prison'), dari (d\u00e2ru 'powder/gunpowder, medicine'), duran (dur 'telescope'), duranbai (durbin 'telescope/microscope'), dewter (daftar 'notebook'), hurmast (Ohrmazd 'high God'), sawan (s\u00e2bun 'soap'), sandal (sandali 'stool'), and com (j\u00e2m 'cup').\nChinese loanwords include banz (\u677f\u5b50 b\u01cenzi 'board'), laa (\u8721 l\u00e0 'candle'), luuwan (\u841d\u535c lu\u00f3bo 'radish'), huluu (\u846b\u82a6 h\u00falu 'gourd'), denl\u00fc\u00fc (\u706f\u8def d\u0113ngl\u00f9 'lamp'), chiiden (\u6c7d\u706f q\u00ecd\u0113ng 'electric lamp'), biir (\u7b14\u513f b\u01d0r 'paintbrush'), gambanz (\u65a9\u677f\u5b50 zh\u01cenb\u01cenzi 'cutting board'), chinzhuu (\u9752\u6912 q\u012bngji\u0101o 'pepper'), zhuucai (\u97ed\u83dc ji\u01d4c\u00e0i 'leek'), moog (\u8611\u83c7 m\u00f3gu 'mushroom'), cuu (\u918b c\u00f9 'vinegar, soy sauce'), baicaa (\u767d\u83dc b\u00e1ic\u00e0i 'cabbage'), mantuu (\u9992\u5934 m\u00e1ntou 'steamed bun'), naimaa/maimaa (\u4e70\u5356 m\u01ceim\u00e0i 'trade'), goimon (\u6302\u9762 g\u00f9ami\u00e0n 'noodles'), dan (\u5355 d\u0101n 'single'), gan (\u94a2 g\u0101ng 'steel'), lantuu (\u6994\u5934 l\u00e1ngtou 'sledgehammer'), conh (\u7a97\u6237 ch\u016banghu 'window'), buuz (\u5305\u5b50 b\u0101ozi 'dumplings'), huushuur (\u706b\u70e7\u513f h\u01d4osh\u0101or 'fried dumpling'), zutan (\u4e73\u8102\u6c64 r\u01d4zh\u012bt\u0101ng 'cream soup'), bantan (\u7c89\u6c64 f\u011bnt\u0101ng 'flour soup'), zhan (\u9171 ji\u00e0ng 'soy'), wan (\u738b w\u00e1ng 'king'), g\u00fcnzh (\u516c\u4e3b g\u014dngzh\u01d4 'princess'), g\u00fcn (\u516c g\u014dng 'duke'), zhanzhin (\u5c06\u519b ji\u0101ngj\u016bn 'general'), taigan (\u592a\u76d1 t\u00e0iji\u00e0n 'eunuch'), pyanz (\u7247\u5b50 pi\u00e0nzi 'recorded disc'), guanz (\u9986\u5b50 gu\u01cenzi 'restaurant'), lianhua (\u83b2\u82b1 li\u00e1nhu\u0101 'lotus'), huar (\u82b1\u513f hu\u0101r 'flower'), toor (\u6843\u513f t\u00e1or 'peach'), intoor (\u6a31\u6843\u513f y\u012bngt\u00e1or 'cherry'), zeel (\u501f ji\u00e8 'borrow, lend'), wandui (\u8c4c\u8c46 w\u0101nd\u00f2u 'pea'), yanz (\u6837\u5b50 y\u00e0ngzi 'manner, appearance'), shinzh (\u6027\u8d28 x\u00ecngzh\u00ec 'characteristic'), liir (\u68a8\u513f l\u00edr 'pear'), bai (\u724c p\u00e1izi 'target'), zhin(g) (\u65a4 j\u012bn 'weight'), bin(g) (\u997c b\u01d0ng 'pancake'), huanli (\u7687\u5386 hu\u00e1ngli 'calendar'), shaazan (\u70e7\u74f7 sh\u0101oc\u00ed 'porcelain'), hantaaz (\u780d\u515c\u809a k\u01cend\u014dudu 'sleeveless vest'), p\u00fcnt\u00fc\u00fcz (\u7c89\u6761\u5b50 f\u011bnti\u00e1ozi 'potato noodles'), and cai (\u8336 ch\u00e1 'tea').\nIn the 20th century, many Russian loanwords entered the Mongolian language, including doktor 'doctor', shokolad 'chocolate', wagon 'train wagon', kalendar 'calendar', sistem 'system', podwoolk (from futbolka 'T-shirt'), and mashin 'car'.\nIn more recent times, due to socio-political reforms, Mongolian has loaned various words from English; some of which have gradually evolved as official terms: menezhment 'management', komputer 'computer', fail 'file', marketing 'marketing', kredit 'credit', onlain 'online', and mesezh 'message'. Most of these are confined to the Mongolian state.\nOther languages have borrowed words from Mongolian. Examples (Mongolian in brackets) include Persian \u06a9\u0634\u064a\u0643\u0686\u0649 ke\u0161ikci (from heshig 'royal guard'), \u0642\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0648\u0644 qarq\u00e2vol (from girgawl 'pheasant'), \u062c\u06cc\u0628\u0647 jibe (from zhebseg 'iron armour'), \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u063a\u0647 d\u00e2ruqe (from darga 'chief of commandant'), \u0642\u06cc\u0686\u06cc qeyci (from kayichi 'scissors'); Uzbek orol (from aral 'island'); Chinese \u885a\u8855 hutong (from gudum 'passageway'), \u7ad9\u8d64 zhanchi (from zhamchi 'courier/post station'); Middle Chinese \u72a2 duk (from tugul 'calf'); Korean \uc218\ub77c sura (from sh\u00fcle 'royal meal'), \uc545\ub300 akdae (from agta 'castrated animal'), \uc5c5\uc9c4 eobjin (from ebchig\u00fcn 'chest of an animal'); Old English cocer (from k\u00f6k\u00fc\u00fcr 'container'); Old French quivre (from k\u00f6k\u00fc\u00fcr 'container'); Old High German Baldrian (from balchirgan-a 'valerian plant'). K\u00f6k\u00fc\u00fcr and balchirgan-a are thought to have been brought to Europe by the Huns or Pannonian Avars.\nDespite having a diverse range of loanwords, Mongolian dialects such as Khalkha and Khorchin, within a comparative vocabulary of 452 words of Common Mongolic vocabulary, retain as many as 95% of these native words, contrasting e.g. with Southern Mongolic languages at 39\u201377% retentions.\n\nWriting systems\nMongolian has been written in a variety of alphabets, making it a language with one of the largest number of scripts used historically. The earliest stages of Mongolian (Xianbei, Wuhuan languages) may have used an indigenous runic script as indicated by Chinese sources. The Khitan large script adopted in 920 CE is an early Mongol (or according to some, para-Mongolic) script.\nThe traditional Mongolian script was first adopted by Genghis Khan in 1204, who recognized the need to represent his own people's language. It developed from the Uyghur script when several members of the Uyghur elite who were brought into the Mongol confederation early on shared their knowledge of their written language with the Mongol imperial clan. Among the Uyghurs sharing that knowledge were Tata-tonga (Chinese: \u5854\u5854\u7d71\u963f), Bilge Buqa (\u6bd4\u4fda\u4f3d\u666e\u83ef), Kara Igach Buyruk (\u54c8\u524c\u4ea6\u54c8\u8d64\u5317\u9b6f), and Mengsus (\u5b5f\u901f\u601d). From that time, the script underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementation.\nBetween 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state. In 1941, the Latin alphabet was adopted, though it lasted only two months.\nThe Mongolian Cyrillic script was the result of the spreading of Russian influence following the expansion of the Russian Empire. The establishment of Soviet Union helped the influence continue, and the Cyrillic alphabet was slowly introduced with the effort by Russian/Soviet linguists in collaboration with their Mongolian counterparts. It was made mandatory by government decree in 1941. The introduction of the Cyrillic script, with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed to the success of the large-scale government literacy campaign, which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950. Earlier government campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, employing the traditional script, had only managed to raise literacy from 3.0% to 17.3% between 1921 and 1940. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt at reintroducing the traditional alphabet failed in the face of popular resistance. In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of the Latin alphabet is common.\nIn the People's Republic of China, Mandarin Chinese is the official language along with Mongolian in some regions, notably the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet has always been used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split. There are two types of written Mongolian used in China: the traditional Mongolian script, which is official among Mongols nationwide, and the Clear Script, used predominantly among Oirats in Xinjiang.\nIn March 2020, the Mongolian government announced plans to use both Cyrillic and the traditional Mongolian script in official documents by 2025.\n\nExample text\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Mongolian, written in the Cyrillic alphabet:\n\n\u0425\u04af\u043d \u0431\u04af\u0440 \u0442\u04e9\u0440\u0436 \u043c\u044d\u043d\u0434\u043b\u044d\u0445\u044d\u0434 \u044d\u0440\u0445 \u0447\u04e9\u043b\u04e9\u04e9\u0442\u044d\u0439, \u0430\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0445\u0430\u043d \u043d\u044d\u0440 \u0442\u04e9\u0440\u0442\u044d\u0439, \u0438\u0436\u0438\u043b \u044d\u0440\u0445\u0442\u044d\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u0433. \u041e\u044e\u0443\u043d \u0443\u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d, \u043d\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0447\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0440 \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u0445\u04af\u043d \u0433\u044d\u0433\u0447 \u04e9\u04e9\u0440 \u0445\u043e\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043e \u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d \u0434\u04af\u04af\u0433\u0438\u0439\u043d \u04af\u0437\u044d\u043b \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0430\u0440 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0446\u0430\u0445 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0439.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Mongolian transliteration:\n\nH\u00fcn b\u00fcr t\u00f6rj mendlehed erh ch\u00f6l\u00f6\u00f6tei, adilhan ner t\u00f6rtei, ijil erhtei baidag.

Below is a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the Wikipedia article on the Mongolian language:\n\n### Phonology\n\n#### Vowels\n- **Vowel Harmony**: Mongolian vowels are categorized into three groups based on Advanced Tongue Root (ATR) harmony: \u2212ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This system supersedes the historical front-back vowel distinction.\n- **Vowel Length**: Length is phonemic, with long vowels being about 208% the length of short vowels in initial syllables.\n- **Diphthongs**: Mongolian has four main diphthongs: /ui/, /\u028ai/, /\u0254i/, /ai/, pronounced as [\u0289e\u032f, \u028ae\u032f, \u025ee\u032f, \u00e6e\u032f].\n- **Rounding Harmony**: Applies to open vowels, influenced by the presence of /o/ or /\u0254/ in the stem.\n\n#### Consonants\n- **Consonant Inventory**: Includes unique sounds like the voiced alveolar lateral fricative /\u026e/, often realized as voiceless [\u026c].\n- **Syllable Structure**: Maximal syllable structure is CVVCCC, with specific restrictions on consonant clusters.\n\n### Grammar\n\n#### Morphology\n- **Agglutinative Language**: Mongolian relies heavily on suffixes for grammatical functions.\n- **Nouns**: \n  - **Cases**: Mongolian has between seven and nine cases, including nominative, accusative, genitive, dative-locative, ablative, instrumental, comitative, privative, and directive.\n  - **Plural Formation**: Plurals are formed using suffixes like -\u043d\u0443\u0443\u0434/-\u043d\u04af\u04af\u0434, -\u0443\u0443\u0434/-\u04af\u04af\u0434, -\u043d\u0430\u0440, and irregular forms like \u0445\u04af\u043c\u04af\u04af\u0441 for 'people'.\n- **Pronouns**: Personal pronouns exist for first and second person, with demonstrative pronouns forming the basis for third person pronouns.\n\n#### Verbs\n- **Verb Conjugation**: Verbs have a stem and an ending, with various suffixes indicating tense, aspect, and mood.\n  - **Present/Future Tense**: Formed by adding -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u044d, or -\u043d\u04e9 to the stem.\n  - **Past Tense**: Includes suffixes like -\u0441\u0430\u043d/-\u0441\u043e\u043d/-\u0441\u044d\u043d/-\u0441\u04e9\u043d, -\u0432, -\u043b\u0430\u0430/-\u043b\u043e\u043e/-\u043b\u044d\u044d/-\u043b\u04e9\u04e9, and -\u0436\u044d\u044d/-\u0447\u044d\u044d.\n  - **Negation**: Formed using suffixes like -\u0433\u04af\u0439 and particles like \u0431\u0438\u0448 and \u04af\u0433\u04af\u0439.\n\n#### Syntax\n- **Word Order**: Subject\u2013object\u2013predicate is the unmarked order, but other phrases can change order or disappear.\n- **Differential Case Marking**: Mongolian uses differential object marking (DOM) and differential subject marking (DSM) in embedded clauses.\n- **Complex Sentences**: Converbs and verbal nouns in the dative or instrumental case are used to conjoin clauses.\n\n### Writing Systems\n- **Scripts**: Mongolian has been written in various scripts, including the traditional Mongolian script, Cyrillic, and Latin.\n- **Current Usage**: In Mongolia, Cyrillic is predominant, while the traditional script is used in Inner Mongolia, China.\n\n### Example Text\n- **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**: Provides a practical example of Mongolian text in Cyrillic, traditional script, and transliteration.\n\n### Additional Resources\n- **Loanwords**: Understanding the influence of languages like Russian, Chinese, and Sanskrit on Mongolian vocabulary can aid in translation.\n- **Online Tools**: Resources like the Bolor Mongolian-English dictionary can be invaluable for translators.\n\nThis detailed overview provides a foundation for translating text into Mongolian, covering essential aspects of its phonology, grammar, and writing systems.", "updated": "2025-03-04T21:26:34.520307"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language": {"base_content": "The Klingon language (Klingon: tlhIngan Hol, pIqaD: \uf8e4\uf8d7\uf8dc\uf8d0\uf8db \uf8d6\uf8dd\uf8d9, pronounced [\u02c8t\u0361\u026c\u026a.\u014b\u0251n xol]) is the constructed language spoken by a fictional alien race called the Klingons in the Star Trek universe.\nDescribed in the 1985 book The Klingon Dictionary by Marc Okrand and deliberately designed to sound \"alien\", it has a number of typologically uncommon features. The language's basic sound, along with a few words, was devised by actor James Doohan (\"Scotty\") and producer Jon Povill for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The film marked the first time the language had been heard. In all previous appearances, Klingons spoke in English, even to each other. Klingon was subsequently developed by Okrand into a full-fledged language.\nKlingon is sometimes referred to as Klingonese (most notably in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", where it was actually pronounced by a Klingon character as \"Klingonee\" ), but among the Klingon-speaking community, this is often understood to refer to another Klingon language called Klingonaase that was introduced in John M. Ford's 1984 Star Trek novel The Final Reflection, and appears in other Star Trek novels by Ford.\nThe play A Klingon Christmas Carol is the first production that is primarily in Klingon (only the narrator speaks English). The opera \u02bcu\u02bc is entirely in Klingon.\nA small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Because its vocabulary is heavily centered on Star Trek-Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, it can be hard for everyday use because of the lack of words for a casual conversation.\n\nHistory\nThe language is first mentioned in the original Star Trek series episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" (1967), but is not heard until Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). According to the actor who spoke the lines, Mark Lenard, James Doohan recorded the lines he had written on a tape, and Lenard transcribed the recorded lines in a way he found useful in learning them.\nFor Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), director Leonard Nimoy and writer-producer Harve Bennett wanted the Klingons to speak a structured language instead of random gibberish, and so commissioned a full language, based on the phrases Doohan had originated, from Marc Okrand, who had earlier constructed four lines of Vulcan dialogue for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.:\u200a266\u2013267\u200a\nOkrand enlarged the lexicon and developed a grammar based on Doohan's original dozen words. The language appeared intermittently in later films featuring the original cast; for example, in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989) and in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), where translation difficulties served as a plot device.\nTwo \"non-canon\" dialects of Klingon are hinted at in the novelization of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, as Saavik speaks in Klingon to the only Klingon officer aboard Cpt. Kruge's starship after his death, as the survivors of the Enterprise's self-destruction transport up from the crumbling Genesis Planet to the Klingon ship. The surviving officer, Maltz, states that he speaks the Rumaiy dialect, while Saavik is speaking to him in the Kumburan dialect of Klingon, per Maltz's spoken reply to her.\nWith the advent of the series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987)\u2014in which one of the main characters, Worf, was a Klingon\u2014and successors, the language and various cultural aspects for the fictional species were expanded. In the episode \"A Matter of Honor\", several members of a Klingon ship's crew speak a language that is not translated for the benefit of the viewer (even Commander Riker, enjoying the benefits of a universal translator, is unable to understand) until one Klingon orders the others to \"speak their [i.e., human] language\".\nA small number of non-Klingon characters were later depicted in Star Trek as having learned to speak Klingon, notably Jean-Luc Picard and Dax.\n\nLanguage\nHobbyists around the world have studied the Klingon language. At least nine Klingon translations of works of world literature have been published, among which are: Hamlet (Hamlet), ghIlghameS (The Epic of Gilgamesh), paghmo\u02bc tIn mIS  (Much Ado About Nothing), pIn\u02bca\u02bc qan paQDI\u02bcnorgh (Tao Te Ching), Sun pIn\u02bca\u02bc veS mIw (The Art of War), chIjwI' tIQ bom (The Rime of the Ancient Mariner), 'aS 'IDnar pIn'a' Dun (The Wonderful Wizard of Oz), ta\u02bcpuq mach (The Little Prince), and QelIS boqHarmey (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). The Shakespearean choices were inspired by a remark from High Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, who said, \"You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.\" In the bonus material on the DVD, screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and actor William Shatner both explain that this was an allusion to the German myth that Shakespeare was in fact German.\nThe Klingon Language Institute exists to promote the language.\nCBS Studios owns the copyright on the official dictionary and other canonical descriptions of the language. While constructed languages (\"conlangs\") are viewed as creations with copyright protection, natural languages are not protected, excluding dictionaries and other works created with them. Mizuki Miyashita and Laura Moll note, \"Copyrights on dictionaries are unusual because the entries in the dictionary are not copyrightable as the words themselves are facts, and facts can not be copyrighted. However, the formatting, example sentences, and instructions for dictionary use are created by the author, so they are copyrightable.\"\nOkrand had studied some Native American and Southeast Asian languages, and phonological and grammatical features of these languages \"worked their way into Klingon, but for the most part, not by design.\" Okrand himself has stated that a design principle of the Klingon language was dissimilarity to existing natural languages in general, and English in particular. He therefore avoided patterns that are typologically common and deliberately chose features that occur relatively infrequently in human languages. This includes above all the highly asymmetric consonant inventory and the basic word order.\n\nSpeakers\nA small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Arika Okrent guessed in her 2009 book In the Land of Invented Languages that there might be 20\u201330 fluent speakers. Its vocabulary, heavily centered on Star Trek\u2013Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use. For instance, while words for transporter ionizer unit (jolvoy\u02bc) or bridge (of a ship) (meH) have been known since close to the language's inception, the word for bridge in the sense of a crossing over water (QI) was unknown until August 2012. Nonetheless, mundane conversations are possible among skilled speakers.\nOne Klingon speaker, d'Armond Speers, raised his son Alec to speak Klingon as a first language, while the boy's mother communicated with him in English. Alec rarely responded to his father in Klingon, although when he did, his pronunciation was \"excellent\". After Alec's fifth birthday, Speers reported that his son eventually stopped responding to him when spoken to in Klingon as he clearly did not enjoy it, so Speers switched to English.\nIn 2007, a report surfaced that Multnomah County, Oregon, was hiring Klingon translators for its mental health program in case patients came into a psychiatric hospital speaking nothing but Klingon. Most circulations of the report seemingly implied that this was a problem that health officials faced before; however, the original report indicated that this was just a precaution for a hypothetical and that said translator would only be paid on an as needed basis. After the report was misinterpreted, the County issued another release noting that releasing the original report was a \"mistake\".\nIn May 2009, Simon & Schuster, in collaboration with Ultralingua Inc., a developer of electronic dictionary applications, announced the release of a suite of electronic Klingon language software for most computer platforms including a dictionary, a phrasebook, and an audio learning tool.\nIn September 2011, Eurotalk released the \"Learn Klingon\" course in its Talk Now! series. The language is displayed in both Latin and pIqaD fonts, making this the first language course written in pIqaD and approved by CBS and Marc Okrand. It was translated by Jonathan Brown and Okrand and uses the Hol-pIqaD TrueType font.\nIn August 2016, a company in the United Kingdom, Bidvine, began offering Klingon lessons as one of their services.\nIn March 2018, the popular language learning site Duolingo opened a beta course in Klingon. After proving popular, the company offered to promote it from beta status, but due to ongoing software issues regarding Klingon's unexpected use of upper- and lower-case letters and the apostrophe as a consonant instead of punctuation, the course developers chose not to accept the offer until the problems were addressed.\nThere are Klingon language meetings and linguists or students are interested in researching this topic, even writing essays about the language or its users.\nKlingon speakers are also referred to in non-Star Trek TV series, including Frasier, The Big Bang Theory, and Lucifer, and were heavily featured in the \"My Big Fat Geek Wedding\" episode of The Simpsons. In the 2017 film Please Stand By, in which a young autistic woman played by Dakota Fanning leaves her group home in San Francisco to deliver a Star Trek screenplay she wrote to Paramount Pictures, a Los Angeles police officer played by Patton Oswalt coaxes her out of hiding by speaking with her in Klingon.\n\nReal world usage\nIn July 2015, the Welsh Government issued a written statement in the Klingon language. Following a formal questioning of the Economy Minister Edwina Hart regarding the funding of research into UFO sightings around Cardiff Airport by Member of the Senedd Darren Millar, a press officer in the Minister's office issued the reply: \n\njang vIDa je due luq. \u02bcach ghotvam\u02bce\u02bc QI\u02bcyaH-devolved qaS\nwhich was translated as: \"The minister will reply in due course. However this is a non-devolved matter.\"\n\nUse in other media\nIn the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill Volume 1 (2003), the opening of the film cites 'Revenge is a dish best served cold' as an 'old Klingon proverb'.\nIn 2010, a Chicago Theatre company presented a version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol in Klingon language and a Klingon setting. On September 25, 2010, the Washington Shakespeare Company (now known as WSC Avant Bard) performed selections from Hamlet and Much Ado About Nothing in the Klingon language in Arlington County, Virginia. The performance was proposed by Okrand in his capacity as chairman of the group's board. This performance was reprised on February 27, 2011 featuring Stephen Fry as the Klingon Osric and was filmed by the BBC as part of a 5-part documentary on language entitled Fry's Planet Word.\nThe Java edition of Minecraft has a Klingon language setting.\nThe 2003\u20132010 version of the puzzle globe logo of Wikipedia, representing its multilingualism, contained a Klingon character. When updated in 2010, the Klingon character was removed from the logo, and substituted with one from the Ge'ez script. A Klingon language Wikipedia was started in June 2004 at tlh.wikipedia.org. It was permanently locked in August 2005 and moved to Wikia. The Klingon Wiktionary was closed in 2008.\nIn the 2010 Dragon Ball Z Abridged episode \"Episode 16\", the Klingon language is used as the same language as the Namekian language.\nThe file management software XYplorer has been translated into Klingon by its developer.\nMicrosoft's Bing Translator attempts to translate Klingon from and to other languages. It can do a good job with individual words, and with phrases included in its training corpus, but it is not well tuned for Klingon's system of prefixes and suffixes. For example, DaHaDnIS \"You must study it\" is rendered instead as \"They Must Study.\"\nWith the digital-only release of Star Trek: Discovery in 2017, streaming service Netflix announced it would provide Klingon subtitles for the entire first season, translated by Klingon language expert Lieven L. Litaer. They can be enabled like any other language provided by the streaming service, and are shown using romanized transliteration rather than Klingon script.\nIn 2020 the German artist Hans Solo (\u00c4i-Tiem) released an EP NuqneH, whose 5 tracks are completely rapped in Klingon language.\n\nLanguage learning sources\nDuolingo features a course for Klingon, which was released on March 15, 2018 and is now in beta testing.\nThe Klingon Language Institute provides a Learn Klingon Online series of lessons to its members. The first few lessons are free to sample.\nMemrise has user-created materials on various topics.\n\nCanon\nAn important concept to spoken and written Klingon is canonicity. Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered canonical Klingon by the KLI and most Klingonists. However, as the growing number of speakers employ different strategies to express themselves, it is often unclear as to what level of neologism is permissible. New vocabulary has been collected in a list maintained by the KLI until 2005 and has since then been followed up by Klingon expert Lieven Litaer until the KLI's website was renewed in 2015.\n\nInternal history\nWithin the fictional universe of Star Trek, Klingon is derived from the original language spoken by the messianic figure Kahless the Unforgettable, who united the Klingon home-world of Qo\u02bcnoS under one empire more than 1500 years ago.\n\nPhonology\nKlingon has been developed with a phonology that, while based on human natural languages, is intended to sound alien to human ears. When initially developed, Paramount Pictures (owners of the Star Trek franchise) wanted the Klingon language to be guttural and harsh and Okrand wanted it to be unusual, so he selected sounds that combined in ways not generally found in other languages. The effect is mainly achieved by the use of a number of retroflex and uvular consonants in the language's inventory. Klingon has twenty-one consonants and five vowels. Klingon is normally written in a variant of the Latin alphabet. The orthography of this transliteration is case-sensitive, that is, upper and lower case letters are not interchangeable (uppercase letters mostly represent sounds different from those expected by English speakers), although with the exception of Q/q there are no minimal pairs between case. In other words, while hol is incorrect Klingon, it cannot be misread as anything but an erroneous form of Hol (which means language); on the other hand, Qat and qat are two different words, the first meaning be popular and the second meaning accompany. In the discussion below, standard Klingon orthography appears in \u27e8angle brackets\u27e9, and the phonemic transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet is written between /slashes/.\n\nConsonants\nThe inventory of consonants in Klingon is spread over a number of places of articulation. In spite of this, the inventory has many gaps: Klingon has no velar plosives, and only one sibilant fricative; common consonants absent in Klingon include /k \u0261 f h s z \u0283/. Deliberately, this arrangement is very different from that of most human languages. The combination of an aspirated voiceless alveolar plosive /t\u02b0/ and a voiced retroflex plosive /\u0256/ is particularly unusual.\n\nThere are a few dialectal pronunciation differences (it is not known if the aforementioned non-canon Kumburan or Rumaiy dialects of tlhIngan Hol hinted at in the novelization of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock might differ):\n\nIn the Krotmag dialect /b/ and /\u0256/ are realized as nasal stops [m] and [\u0273]\nIn the Tak'ev dialect /b/ and /\u0256/ are pre-nasalized oral stops [mb] and [\u0273\u0256]\nIn the Morskan dialect:\n\n/t\u0361\u026c/ is a central affricate [t\u0361s]\n/x/ is realized as glottal [h] syllable-initially and deleted syllable-finally\n/q\u0361\u03c7/ is realized as a velar fricative [x]\n\nVowels\nIn contrast to its consonants, Klingon's inventory of vowels is simple, and similar to those of many human languages, such as Spanish or Japanese. There are five vowels spaced more or less evenly around the vowel space, with two back rounded vowels, one back unrounded vowel, and two front or near-front unrounded vowels. The vowel inventory is asymmetrical in that the back rounded vowels are tense and the front vowels are lax.\nThe two front vowels, \u27e8e\u27e9 and \u27e8I\u27e9, represent sounds that are found in English, but are more open and lax than a typical English speaker might assume when reading Klingon text written in the Latin alphabet, thus causing the consonants of a word to be more prominent. This enhances the sense that Klingon is a clipped and harsh-sounding language.\n\nVowels\n\u27e8a\u27e9 \u2013 /\u0251/ \u2013 open back unrounded vowel (in English spa)\n\u27e8e\u27e9 \u2013 /\u025b/ \u2013 open-mid front unrounded vowel (in English bed)\n\u27e8I\u27e9 \u2013 /\u026a/ \u2013 near-close near-front unrounded vowel (in English bit)\n\u27e8o\u27e9 \u2013 /o/ \u2013 close-mid back rounded vowel (in French eau and English snow)\n\u27e8u\u27e9 \u2013 /u/ \u2013 close back rounded vowel (in Spanish tu and English you)\nDiphthongs can be analyzed phonetically as the combination of the five vowels plus one of the two semivowels /w/ and /j/ (represented by \u27e8w\u27e9 and \u27e8y\u27e9, respectively). Thus, the combinations \u27e8ay\u27e9, \u27e8ey\u27e9, \u27e8Iy\u27e9, \u27e8oy\u27e9, \u27e8uy\u27e9, \u27e8aw\u27e9, \u27e8ew\u27e9 and \u27e8Iw\u27e9 are possible. There are no words in the Klingon language that contain *\u27e8ow\u27e9 or *\u27e8uw\u27e9.\n\nSyllable structure\nKlingon follows a strict syllable structure. A syllable must start with a consonant (including the glottal stop) followed by one vowel. In prefixes and rare other syllables, this is enough. More commonly, this consonant-vowel pair is followed by one consonant or one of three biconsonantal codas: /-w\u02bc -y\u02bc -rgh/. Thus, ta \"record\", tar \"poison\" and targh \"targ\" (a type of animal) are all legal syllable forms, but *tarD and *ar are not. Despite this, one suffix takes the shape vowel+consonant: the endearment suffix -oy.\n\nStress\nIn verbs, the stressed syllable is usually the verbal stem itself, as opposed to a prefix or any suffixes, except when a suffix ending with \u27e8\u02bc\u27e9 is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix, in which case the suffix ending in \u27e8\u02bc\u27e9 is also stressed. In addition, stress may shift to a suffix that is meant to be emphasized.\nIn nouns, the final syllable of the stem (the noun itself, excluding any affixes) is stressed. If any syllables ending in \u27e8\u02bc\u27e9 are present, the stress shifts to those syllables.\nThe stress in other words seems to be variable, but this is not a serious issue because most of these words are only one syllable in length. There are some words which should fall under the rules above, but do not, although using the standard rules would still be acceptable.\n\nGrammar\nKlingon is an agglutinative language, using mainly affixes in order to alter the function or meaning of words. Some nouns have inherently plural forms, such as jengva\u02bc \"plate\" (vs. ngop \"plates\"), but most nouns require a suffix to express plurality explicitly. Depending on the type of noun (body part, being capable of using language, or neither) the suffix changes. For beings capable of using language, the suffix is -pu\u02bc, as in tlhInganpu\u02bc, meaning \"Klingons,\" or jaghpu\u02bc, meaning \"enemies\". For body parts, the plural suffix is -Du\u02bc, as in mInDu\u02bc, \"eyes\". For items that are neither body parts nor capable of speech, the suffix is -mey, such as in Hovmey (\"stars\"), or targhmey (\"targs\") for a Klingon animal somewhat resembling a boar. (However, a plural suffix is never obligatory. To say \"The stars are beautiful\", \u02bcIH Hovmey and \u02bcIH Hov are equally grammatical, although the second can also mean \"The star is beautiful\".)\nThe words loD and be\u02bc, which on their own mean \"man\" and \"woman\" respectively, can be used in compound words to refer to the referent's sex. For example, from puq (\"child\") this process derives puqloD (\"son\") and puqbe\u02bc (\"daughter\").\nKlingon nouns take suffixes to indicate grammatical number. There are three noun classes, two levels of deixis, and a possession and syntactic function. In all, twenty-nine noun suffixes from five classes may be employed: jupoypu\u02bcna\u02bcwI\u02bcvaD \"for my beloved true friends\". A word may carry no more than one suffix from each class, and the classes have a specific order of appearance.\nVerbs in Klingon take a prefix indicating the number and person of the subject and object, whereas suffixes are taken from nine ordered classes and a special suffix class called rovers. Each of the four known rovers has a unique rule controlling its position among the suffixes in the verb. Verbs are marked for aspect, certainty, predisposition and volition, dynamic, causative, mood, negation, and honorific. The Klingon verb has two moods: indicative and imperative.\nThe most common word order in Klingon is object\u2013verb\u2013subject, and, in most cases, the word order is the exact reverse of English for an equivalent sentence:\n\n(Hyphens are used in the above only to illustrate the use of affixes. Hyphens are not used in Klingon.)\nAn important aspect of Klingon grammar is its \"ungrammaticality\". As with for example Japanese, shortening of communicative statements is common, and is called \"Clipped Klingon\" (tlhIngan Hol poD or, more simply, Hol poD) and Ritualized Speech. Clipped Klingon is especially useful in situations where speed is a decisive factor. Grammar is abbreviated, and sentence parts deemed to be superfluous are dropped. Intentional ungrammaticality is widespread, and it takes many forms. It is exemplified by the practice of pabHa\u02bc, which Marc Okrand translates as \"to misfollow the rules\" or \"to follow the rules wrongly\".\n\nWriting systems\nWhen written in the Latin alphabet, Klingon is unusual in being case-sensitive, with some letters written in capitals and others in lowercase. In one contrast, q and Q, there is an actual case-sensitive pair representing two different consonants. Capitals are generally reserved for uvular or retroflex consonants pronounced further back in the mouth or throat than is normal for the corresponding English sounds, as with D, Q, and S. However, H, pronounced like the \u27e8ch\u27e9 in German \"ach\" or Scottish \"loch\", is further forward in the throat than English /h/. One phoneme, the vowel I, is written capital to look more like the IPA symbol for the sound /\u026a/, and can pose problems when writing Klingon in sans-serif fonts such as Arial, as it looks almost the same as the consonant l.\nThis has led some Klingon enthusiasts to write it lowercase like the other vowels (\"i\") to prevent confusion, but this use is non-canonical. Instead, a serif font that clearly distinguishes \"I\" and \"l\", such as Courier or Courier New, has traditionally been employed for writing Klingon in the Latin alphabet. In any case, it can be disambiguated through context, as I never occurs next to another vowel, while l always does. The apostrophe, denoting the glottal stop, is considered a letter, not a punctuation mark, as with a Hawaiian 'okina.\n\na b ch D e gh H I j l m n ng o p q Q r S t tlh u v w y \u02bc\nKlingon is often written in (in-universe, \"transliterated to\") the Latin alphabet as used above, but on the television series, the Klingons use their own alien writing system. In The Klingon Dictionary, this alphabet is named as pIqaD, but no information is given about it. When Klingon symbols are used in Star Trek productions, they are merely decorative graphic elements, designed to emulate real writing and create an appropriate atmosphere. Enthusiasts have settled on the name pIqaD for this writing system.\nThe Astra Image Corporation designed the symbols currently used to \"write\" Klingon for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, although these symbols are often incorrectly attributed to Michael Okuda. They based the letters on the Klingon battlecruiser hull markings (three letters) first created by Matt Jefferies and on Tibetan writing because the script has sharp letter forms\u2014used as a testament to the Klingons' love for knives and blades.\nFor April Fools' Day in 2013, Nokia and typography company Dalton Maag claimed to have used \"communication devices to far-flung star systems\" to assist them in localizing the Nokia Pure font to the Klingon writing system. Though the explanation was of course humorous in nature, as part of the practical joke a series of real fonts based upon the most commonly used pIqaD character mapping were in fact developed, and have been made available for free download.\n\nVocabulary\nA design principle of the Klingon language is the great degree of lexical-cultural correlation in the vocabulary. For example, there are several words meaning \"to fight\" or \"to clash against\", each having a different degree of intensity. There is an abundance of words relating to warfare and weaponry and also a great variety of curses (cursing is considered a fine art in Klingon culture). This helps lend a particular character to the language.\nThere are many in-jokes built into the language. For example, the word for \"pair\" is chang\u02bceng, a reference to the original \"Siamese twins\" Chang and Eng Bunker; a leSpal is a mid-size stringed instrument, comparable to a guitar (i.e. Les Paul); a \"chronometer\" is tlhaq (pronounced similar to \"clock\"); the word for \"torture\" is joy; \"hangover\" is \u02bcuH, and the word for \"fish\" is ghotI\u02bc.\nSources for the vocabulary include English (albeit heavily disguised), and also Yiddish: Sa\u02bcHut for \"buttocks\" (from \u05ea\u05bc\u05d7\u05ea tuches spelled backwards), and \u02bcoy\u02bc for \"ache, pain, sore\" (cf. oy vey).\nMany English words do not have direct translations into Klingon. To express \"hello\", the nearest equivalent is nuqneH, meaning \"What do you want?\", with \"goodbye\" translated as Qapla', \"Success!\".\n\nExample sentences\ntlhIngan Hol Dajatlh\u02bca\u02bc?\nDo you speak Klingon?\njIyajbe\u02bc.\nI don't understand.\nDochvetlh vISoplaHbe\u02bc.\nI can't eat that thing.\nbIlughbe\u02bc.\nYou are wrong.\nbortaS bIr jablu\u02bcDI\u02bc reH QaQqu\u02bc nay\u02bc.\nRevenge is a dish best served cold.
