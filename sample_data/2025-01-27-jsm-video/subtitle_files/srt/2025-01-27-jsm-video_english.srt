Hello, my name is Jonathan Samir Matthis and I am a professor of neuroscience in Boston,


2
0:00:04,220 --> 0:00:09,260
Massachusetts, USA. Now it's a rather long story, but these days I spend most of my time building


3
0:00:09,260 --> 0:00:14,100
free open source software based on technologies that I am familiar with as a result of my


4
0:00:14,100 --> 0:00:19,820
scientific research. And this is one of them. So what you should be seeing is a transcription of


5
0:00:19,820 --> 0:00:23,920
the words that I'm saying in English and then the translation of those words into several other


6
0:00:23,920 --> 0:00:28,260
languages below. And if you pause the video at any point in time, it should be highlighting the word


7
0:00:28,260 --> 0:00:32,900
I'm currently saying in English and then the closest matching word in the translations below.


8
0:00:33,380 --> 0:00:39,220
Let's give that a quick test. One, two, three, four, five, red, blue, green, yellow, pink,


9
0:00:39,259 --> 0:00:43,320
my dad is from Texas, my mom is from Syria, my brother is named Paul and I have two cats


10
0:00:43,320 --> 0:00:48,020
named Poo and Ollie. Which way is the library? Okay, thank you, nice to meet you. So that's the


11
0:00:48,020 --> 0:00:53,360
basic idea. If you speak any of these languages, please let me know how it goes, especially in the


12
0:00:53,400 --> 0:00:58,240
word highlight matching thing. And if you're interested in this project, I would love to


13
0:00:58,240 --> 0:00:59,060
let me know.
