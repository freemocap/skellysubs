NOTES (pre-recording)

- hello my name is JSM
- Professor of neuroscience in Boston MA USA
- Now - its a rather long story that I'd love to tell yo usome time, but these days
- I spend most of my time buing FOSS tools based on emerging technologies that I am familar AARO my scientific reserch

And what you're seeing in front of you righ tnow is one of those

So what you shold be seing is a transcription of what I am saying in english followed by translation to a few other languages

And if you pause the video, hypothetically at any moment in time it should be highlighting the text that I am currently speaking, along with the closest matching word in the other languages. 

Lets give that a quick test: 
- 1,2,3,4,5
- red, blue, green, yellow, pink
- dog, cat, cow, chicken
- My dad is from Texas and my mom is from Syria. My brother is named Paul, and I have two cats named Pooh and Ollie. 
- Which way is the library
- Ok, thank you, nice to meet you!

So, that's the basic idea. If you speak any of these languages, please let me know how it does (esp at the word-level highlighting, during the more complicated linguistic parts of the video) 

This is a proof of concept, the code is fully free and open source obviously, and you can find it at 

GitHub Slash FreeMoCap slash Skellysubs 

Now, there is a LOT more that I would love to say about this, and I'm certain you have questions, so please ask -
I would love to answer

I would also love to develop this project into a more robust fully fledged tool and free open source project, so you if you have interest in using this or contributing to it, please stick around!

Ok, real curious to see what it does with that 

Ok, Thank you! Have a lovely day! Bye!
