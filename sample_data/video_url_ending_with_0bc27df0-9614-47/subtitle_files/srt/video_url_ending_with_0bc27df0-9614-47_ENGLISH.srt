0:00:09,260 --> 0:00:14,100
free open source software based on technologies that I am familiar with as a result of my


4
0:00:14,100 --> 0:00:19,820
scientific research And this is one of them So what you should be seeing is a transcription of


5
0:00:19,820 --> 0:00:23,920
the words that I'm saying in English and then the translation of those words into several other


6
0:00:23,920 --> 0:00:28,260
languages below And if you pause the video at any point in time it should be highlighting the word

0:00:28,260 --> 0:00:32,860
