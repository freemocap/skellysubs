Hello my name is Jonathan Samir Matthis and I am a professor of neuroscience in Boston

0:00:04.260.000 --> 0:00:09.260.000 line:50%
Massachusetts USA Now it's a rather long story but these days I spend most of my time building

0:00:09.260.000 --> 0:00:14.100.000 line:50%
free open source software based on technologies that I am familiar with as a result of my

0:00:14.100.000 --> 0:00:19.820.000 line:50%
scientific research And this is one of them So what you should be seeing is a transcription of

0:00:19.820.000 --> 0:00:23.920.000 line:50%
the words that I'm saying in English and then the translation of those words into several other

0:00:23.920.000 --> 0:00:28.260.000 line:50%
languages below And if you pause the video at any point in time it should be highlighting the word

0:00:28.260.000 --> 0:00:32.860.000 line:50%
I'm currently saying in English and then the closest matching word in the translations below

0:00:33.380.000 --> 0:00:40.439.000 line:50%
Let's give that a quick test 1 2 3 4 5 Red blue green yellow pink My dad is from Texas

0:00:40.520.000 --> 0:00:44.740.000 line:50%
my mom is from Syria my brother is named Paul and I have two cats named Poo and Ollie Which

0:00:44.740.000 --> 0:00:50.340.000 line:50%
way is the library Okay thank you nice to meet you So that's the basic idea If you speak any of

0:00:50.340.000 --> 0:00:54.820.000 line:50%
these languages please let me know how it goes especially in the word highlight matching thing

0:00:54.820.000 --> 0:00:59.080.000 line:50%
And if you're interested in this project I would love to develop it so let me know
