# SkellySubs 💀💬
### Browser-based multilingual video translation and subtitling tool

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is still in early development and may not be fully functional yet. Expect broken things and missing features 😌

## Overview
Skellysubs provides in-browser video translation and subtitling capabilities. Video processing is handled client-side using ffmpeg.wasm, keeping server load light enough to wrangle significant-ish traffic on a free-tier GCP Cloud Run instance 🤞😅

#### Roughtly how it works

## Development Setup

### Backend
1. Install `uv`: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv
.venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```
4. Run the server:
```bash
python skellysubs/__main__.py
```
The API documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the UI directory:
```bash
cd skellysubs-ui
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment
Commits to the `production` branch automatically trigger deployment to Google Cloud Run.

## Data Privacy & Usage
- No video, audio, or translation data is stored on our servers  
- Translations are processed through OpenAI's API and subject to their standard privacy policy
- All video processing occurs in your browser (using a WebAssembly version of ffmpeg bundled along with the webpage) 
- OpenAI API costs are currently covered by the FreeMoCap Foundation as a service to the community
- If usage grows beyond our free-tier infrastructure capacity or token costs become prohibitive... we'll figure something out ❤️


## Docker
For local containerized testing:
```bash
docker build -t skellysubs . && docker run -p 8080:8080 --name skellysubs-docker skellysubs
```

# SkellySubs Architecture Overview

## Overall Architecture
A full-stack web application with:
- **Python FastAPI** backend
- **React/TypeScript** frontend
- **Redux** state management
- **FFmpeg.wasm** client-side video processing
- **WebSocket** communication
- **Containerized** deployment (Docker + Cloud Run)

## Key Architectural Components

### Client-Side (`skellysubs-ui/`)
```typescript App.tsx
- **Core Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **State Management**:
  - Redux Toolkit with slices for processing status, subtitles, logs
  - Thunks for async operations (file processing, API calls)
- **Video Processing**:
  - FFmpeg.wasm integration via context providers
  - Subtitle editor components with timeline visualization
- **UI System**:
  - Configurable panel layouts
  - Multi-stage processing workflow
  - Real-time logging terminal

### Backend Service (`skellysubs/`)
```python server_manager.py
- **Core Framework**: FastAPI with REST/WS endpoints
- **Key Modules**:
  - AI Service integration (OpenAI/HuggingFace/Ollama)
  - Video processing pipeline (transcription/translation/subtitles)
  - WebSocket server for real-time updates
- **Main Components**:
  - `core/`: Business logic
  - `api/`: Endpoint routers
  - `ai_clients/`: Provider strategies

## Notable Architectural Patterns

### Client-Side Video Processing
```typescript useFfmpeg.ts
- FFmpeg.wasm for browser-based processing
- Avoids server-side resource usage
- Enables offline-capable workflows

### AI Service Abstraction
```python ai_client_strategy.py
- Strategy pattern implementation
- Unified interface for multiple providers
- Easy integration of new AI services

### Real-Time Updates
```typescript useWebSocket.ts
- WebSocket service for:
  - Processing progress
  - Log streaming
  - System status
- Redux middleware integration

## Deployment Architecture
```dockerfile Dockerfile
- Single container deployment:
  - Python backend (UVicorn)
  - Pre-built React frontend
  - FFmpeg.wasm dependencies
- Cloud Run optimized
- Stateless design:
  - Client-side state management
  - No persistent storage

## Key Dependencies

### Frontend
```json package.json
- @ffmpeg/ffmpeg - WASM video processing
- @mui/material - UI components
- react-resizable-panels - Layout system

### Backend
```toml pyproject.toml
- fastapi - Web framework
- openai - AI integrations
- moviepy - Video processing
